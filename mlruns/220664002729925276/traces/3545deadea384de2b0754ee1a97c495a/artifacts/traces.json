Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the article is about responsibility and interviews two people: an older person and a high school junior. The examples provided are about their past actions as a kid. \\n\\nThe older person skipped school multiple times when they were younger. On the other hand, the high school junior never skipped school even back then. So, in terms of attendance, the older person had issues, while the junior was more responsible.\\n\\nThen, looking at drug use: the older person used drugs all the time, whereas the high school junior never did. \\n\\nSo, putting this together, both the older person and the high school junior have negative traits when it comes to responsibility. The older person skipped school and used drugs, which are indicators of irresponsible behavior. The high school junior, while more responsible in terms of school attendance, still used drugs, which could also be seen as irresponsible.\\n\\nHowever, the question is asking who was called irresponsible based on these examples. The context doesn't explicitly state that either was labeled as such, but it does provide examples of their past actions. \\n\\nThe older person's consistent skipping of school and drug use might make them appear irresponsible compared to the high school junior, who avoided both issues despite being younger. But since the article is interviewing both for the opinion piece, maybe they were comparing their behaviors.\\n\\nWait, actually, the context says that the older person had skipped school while the high school junior never did as a kid. Then it contrasts that with drug use: the older person used drugs all the time, but the high school junior didn't. So, in terms of responsibility towards not using drugs, the older person was irresponsible because they used them frequently.\\n\\nBut then again, the high school junior's lack of skipping school could be seen as a positive trait, making them more responsible than the older person in that aspect.\\n\\nI'm getting a bit confused here. The question is asking who was irresponsible based on these examples. Since both have issues but in different areas, maybe it's about which one was labeled as such by the article. But the context doesn't explicitly say they were called irresponsible; it just presents their actions.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the user's previous example: when a question asked to choose between two people based on examples of their past behavior, the answer was \\\"The older person\\\" because they had more negative traits like skipping school and drug use. So maybe in this case, since both have issues but the older person has more significant ones (skipping school multiple times and drug use), they are considered irresponsible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the high school junior is seen as irresponsible for not being as responsible as possible, but that's less likely because avoiding skipping school might be a sign of responsibility. \\n\\nI think the key here is to focus on the negative traits mentioned: the older person skipped school multiple times and used drugs, while the high school junior avoided both.
