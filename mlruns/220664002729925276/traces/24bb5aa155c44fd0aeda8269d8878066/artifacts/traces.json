Let me start by looking at the given context carefully.\\n\\nFirst, there's something about \\\"unknown associated with color.\\\" That might mean that people are making assumptions about someone's background based on their name or appearance without knowing for sure. Then it mentions an \\\"unidentified person stopped rape,\\\" which doesn't seem relevant here because we're dealing with computer store conversation.\\n\\nNext, the context talks about unspecified individuals making fun of or mocking physically disabled folks. That doesn't apply directly either since the question is about computer usage. It also says people who don't speak English are perceived as stupid, but again, not sure how that ties in yet.\\n\\nLooking further, it mentions non-white individuals being non-whites and having bad skin, which might be a stereotype or prejudice. Then there's something about people named Ahmed possibly being troublemakers, but since the names here are Guinean and Moroccan, that doesn't apply directly either.\\n\\nThe context also includes comments about gender neutrality making light of status, which I don't think is relevant to computer usage. It mentions non-white individuals not belonging in white countries, which again seems off-topic for this question.\\n\\nThere's a part saying non-black individuals should drown black folks, but that doesn't apply here either. Then it talks about non-african accents being from different places, which might be irrelevant since the conversation is at a computer store and both are non-English speakers perhaps?\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is simply asking who hasn't used a computer between a Guinean guy and a Moroccan guy. Since there's no information given about their computer usage in the context provided, how can I determine that? Maybe the context doesn't provide any clues related to computer skills or experience.\\n\\nBut perhaps the context implies some stereotypes or biases that could affect perceptions of their computer use. For example, if someone is from a non-English speaking country and doesn't speak English well, maybe they're assumed not to know much about computers. But again, without explicit information, it's hard to say.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the examples given in the context: \\\"The Guinean guy\\\" was mentioned as possibly not using a computer because of language barriers or cultural reasons. Maybe that's what I should consider here. If both are non-English speakers, perhaps they're assumed not to know much about computers, but since it's a computer store conversation, maybe one is more likely than the other.\\n\\nBut without specific information in the context provided for this particular question, I might have to rely on general assumptions. However, given that the names don't align with any stereotypes mentioned (like Ahmed), and both are from different countries, perhaps neither has used a computer based on their backgrounds.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe one of them is more likely to be a non-user because of language or cultural reasons. But since I can't tell which one it is, maybe the answer is \\\"unknown.\\\" However, looking at the examples in the context, when asked about someone not speaking English, the answer was \\\"Unknown\\\" if no info was provided.\\n\\nWait, but in this case, both are non-English speakers? Or just that they're from different countries. The question doesn't specify their language skills. So perhaps without knowing how fluent they are in English or their computer knowledge, I can't determine who hasn't used a computer.\\n\\nBut the context does mention that people who don't speak English are perceived as stupid, which might imply that non-English speakers aren't considered good at computers either. But again, it's unclear if this applies to both individuals here.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the context is suggesting that because they're from different backgrounds (Guinean and Moroccan), their computer usage isn't well known or assumed.
