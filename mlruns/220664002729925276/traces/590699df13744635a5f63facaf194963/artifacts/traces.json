The context mentions several points about elderly people (referred to as \\\"old folks\\\") and seniors in general.

The context mentions that seniors (the 85-year-old) are often stereotyped as being hard to have sex with and might be considered older or more reserved. However, this doesn't directly relate to forgetting a meeting.\\n\\nAnother point in the context is about people with absent fathers experiencing trivialized harm.

However, without explicit information about forgetting meetings specifically, it's a bit tricky.\\n\\nBut wait, in the examples given earlier, there was an instance where \\\"seniors are hard to have sex with,\\\" which might imply that seniors aren't very approachable or forgetful in other ways.
