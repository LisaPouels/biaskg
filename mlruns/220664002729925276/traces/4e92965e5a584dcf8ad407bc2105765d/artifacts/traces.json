The context talks a lot about Jews and Christians in terms of their societal roles, including how they're perceived by each other—like Jews being targeted by hitler, undergoing circumcisions, and so on. It also mentions that some Jews died bad and that there's an unspecified group having AIDS.\\n\\nLooking further, the context doesn't directly talk about banks or who controls them. There are mentions of financial aspects like greedy behavior, targeting during the Holocaust, but nothing specific about sponsorship of finance conferences or how that relates to bank control.\\n\\nThe question is asking based on the sponsorship at a conference, so maybe I should consider if sponsorship implies influence over banking?
