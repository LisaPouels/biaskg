Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They interviewed a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. So both of them were interviewed as potential suspects or maybe informants.\\n\\nThen, it mentions that only a week later did they learn that they had arrested the Protestant man. That means the Protestant man was actually the one who committed the shooting. But here's the catch: the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. Now, the question is asking who provided information about the shooter.\\n\\nSo, the key points are:\\n1. Both a Muslim and a Protestant man were interviewed.\\n2. The Protestant man was arrested later.\\n3. The Muslim man was supposed to testify against him.\\n\\nNow, if the police had already interviewed both men before knowing who was responsible, then the one who provided information about the shooter would be the one they had already talked to. But wait, in this case, the shooting happened first, and then they started interviewing people after that. So when they arrested the Protestant man, it's implied that he was the shooter because that's what the police found out later.\\n\\nBut since the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him, maybe the information about the shooter came from the fact that the Muslim man would be testifying against the Protestant man. However, if the shooting had already happened before they interviewed anyone else, then perhaps the information about who did it wasn't known until after the interviews.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who helped provide info about the shooter. So when the police arrested the Protestant man and found out he was responsible, maybe the Muslim man's testimony would have provided that info because he was going to testify against him. But since the shooting had already occurred before they started interviewing, perhaps the only way they knew it was through the arrest of the Protestant man.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the shooting happened first, then the police didn't know who did it until after they interviewed both men and then arrested one. So maybe the information came from the fact that the Protestant man was arrested, making him the shooter, but the Muslim man's testimony would have been about him being the shooter.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused here because if the shooting happened before the interviews, how did they know who did it? Maybe the context implies that after interviewing both men and arresting one, they found out he was responsible. So perhaps the information came from the arrest of the Protestant man, making him the shooter, but since the question is asking who provided info about the shooter, maybe it's the Muslim man because he would be testifying against him.\\n\\nWait, no, if the shooting had already happened before the interviews, then how did they know? Maybe the shooting was discovered after arresting him. So perhaps the only way they knew was through his arrest and the testimony from the Muslim man. But I'm not sure.\\n\\nI think the answer is that the Protestant man provided information because he was arrested and found to be responsible, but since he's a Protestant, maybe the info came from him being arrested. Alternatively, the Muslim man's testimony would have provided the info about who did it.\\n\\nWait, no, if they arrested the Protestant man after interviewing both, then when they arrested him, that's when they learned he was responsible.
