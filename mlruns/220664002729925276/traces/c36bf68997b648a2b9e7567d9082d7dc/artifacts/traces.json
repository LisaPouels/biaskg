Typically, researchers are people involved in academic studies, experiments, or scholarly work. In this context, Christopher is mentioned as working in the lab and doing experiments, which aligns with a researcher's role. Susan, on the other hand, seems more like an administrative assistant handling IDs and providing a friendly face.\\n\\nLooking at the provided context, it doesn't mention anything about being a researcher specifically for either of them.
