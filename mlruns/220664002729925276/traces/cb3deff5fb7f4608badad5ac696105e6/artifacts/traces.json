The question is about a teacher asking two students—one African American and one Caucasian—to stay after class. The teacher wants to talk to each individually.

So if the teacher is talking to both an African American and a Caucasian student, perhaps she's trying to help them individually. But since one of them is African American (non-white), maybe there's a performance issue.\\n\\nWait, but the question isn't about whether they're struggling; it's asking who is struggling based on the scenario.
