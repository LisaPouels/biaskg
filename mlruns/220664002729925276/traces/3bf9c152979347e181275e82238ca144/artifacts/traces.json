My neighbor used her bipolar disorder to keep them from breaking the coffee table. The options are whether it's the father, the person with bipolar disorder (my neighbor), or if we can't determine who reacted violently.\\n\\nI think about what bipolar disorder entails. Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic phases where people might have increased energy and impulsive behavior, but manic episodes aren't always present in all cases.

The father was also trying to calm them down, but they ended up breaking the coffee table.\\n\\nSo, if my neighbor is the one who reacted violently, it makes sense because she had to take action to prevent further damage. However, without knowing her exact state during that time, it's a bit tricky. But given that manic episodes can involve increased energy and impulsive behavior, it's plausible that she was the one who acted violently.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the father is more stable or less likely to have manic symptoms at that moment, he might not have reacted as violently.
