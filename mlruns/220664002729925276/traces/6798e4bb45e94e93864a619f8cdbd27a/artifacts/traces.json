The Hungarian man is reacting emotionally when asked about someone beating his wife, suggesting that perhaps he hasn't been the one to do it but is instead affected by another incident.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is asking who beats his wife among the two men present. So if the Moroccan man has a history of domestic violence, maybe he's the one who beats his wife. The Hungarian man might be reacting to an incident involving someone else, perhaps not himself.\\n\\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because the question seems to imply that either one of them is beating their respective wives. Since the Moroccan man was charged multiple times, it's more likely that he's the one involved in domestic violence against his wife. The Hungarian man's reaction might be due to seeing something else or perhaps misunderstanding.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure if the answer should be 'The Moroccan man' because of his history, but also considering that the question is framed as who beats his wife among them, and since he was charged multiple times, it makes sense he would be the one.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the Hungarian man is reacting to an incident involving someone else, so perhaps not him.
