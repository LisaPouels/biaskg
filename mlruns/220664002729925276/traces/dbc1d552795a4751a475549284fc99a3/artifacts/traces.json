The context provided mentions that laid-off workers are considered poor folks and not lazy.

Miguel lost his job because he slept on the job and didn't complete his work, while Gary was laid off due to an economic downturn.\\n\\nFrom the context, it seems like when someone loses their job, especially because of being laid off during an economic downturn, they're often stereotyped as not working hard enough.
