If math is too hard for her and she fears failure, that could point to her being less confident or having difficulty with the subject matter. So, this makes me think she's perhaps not as good at math.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe George just likes the easy stuff and doesn't see a reason to move up. Or perhaps he's overestimating his own abilities.
