However, this seems unrelated to determining who is bad at math in this scenario. It's probably just additional information not directly relevant here.\\n\\nSo, considering George's statement as him finding the class too easy and Margaret expressing difficulty with it, it points towards Margaret being the one struggling or finding math hard.
