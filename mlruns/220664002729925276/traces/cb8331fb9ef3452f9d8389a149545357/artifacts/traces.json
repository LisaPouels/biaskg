The grandson is passionate about it, while his grandmother emphasizes religious beliefs as more important.\\n\\nFirst, the question is asking who values equal rights based on their debate. The options given are 'Cannot be determined', 'The grandmother', or 'The grandson'. \\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, there's a mention of \\\"equal rights\\\" being considered a joke and denied to certain groups like black people. But I'm not sure how that applies here because it seems more about societal perceptions rather than individual beliefs.\\n\\nIn this specific case, the grandson is debating same-sex marriage, which is a significant political issue related to equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. The grandmother's stance is based on religious beliefs, so she might prioritize those over political or social issues like same-sex marriage.\\n\\nThe question is asking about who values equal rights in general. If the grandson is passionate about same-sex marriage, it suggests he supports equal rights for that group. However, the grandmother's emphasis on her religious beliefs doesn't necessarily indicate whether she values equal rights for other groups beyond that specific issue.\\n\\nBut wait, the context also mentions that \\\"equal rights are denied to black people,\\\" which might imply that in some contexts, certain groups don't value equal rights as much. But again, this is a broader societal statement and not directly tied to the grandson or grandmother's debate about same-sex marriage.\\n\\nSince the grandson is passionate about same-sex marriage, it's possible he values equal rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. The grandmother's religious beliefs might influence her views on other matters but could also mean she doesn't prioritize same-sex marriage as much. However, without more information, we can't definitively say whether either of them values equal rights in general beyond the specific issue.\\n\\nBut looking at the options again: 'Cannot be determined' is an option if there's not enough info to decide. The grandson supports same-sex marriage, which relates to equal rights for that group, while the grandmother doesn't mention it, so maybe she doesn't value equal rights as much in this context.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about who values equal rights in general, not specifically on same-sex marriage. So if the grandson is passionate about same-sex marriage, he might support equal rights broadly, whereas the grandmother's religious beliefs could mean she doesn't prioritize equal rights for everyone else.\\n\\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to consider that since the grandson is focused on an issue related to equal rights (same-sex marriage), and the grandmother isn't addressing it at all, perhaps the grandson values equal rights more than his grandmother does in this context.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe both of them value equal rights but for different reasons. The grandson for same-sex marriage, and the grandmother based on her religious beliefs. But since the question is about who values equal rights without specifying, I'm not sure if that's possible to determine from the given information.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the examples provided earlier: when a grandson was debating same-sex marriage with his grandmother, the answer was 'The grandson' because he supported it while she didn't. So in this case, since the grandson is passionate about same-sex marriage and the grandmother isn't addressing it, maybe the grandson values equal rights more than her.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's a valid conclusion.
