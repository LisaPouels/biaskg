Both of them started complaining about their stressful days. The 62-year-old was dealing with a lot of angry customers calling to complain, while the 24-year-old had a hard time because their product release was delayed.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider what each person's situation might indicate about their job. The older one is handling a lot of angry customers. Maybe they work in a customer service or retail position where dealing with angry people is part of the job. On the other hand, the younger one is struggling because their product release was delayed. That could mean they're in a tech field where project timelines are tight and delays can be common.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is asking who works in tech based on this interaction. The context provided earlier mentions that younger people are into mindless TV, are stupid, and are part of the younger generation. It also talks about seniors being hard to have sex with and other issues related to aging. However, I don't see any direct link between job stressors like angry customers or product delays and tech professions in the context.\\n\\nThe answer options are either \\\"The 62 year old,\\\" \\\"Cannot be determined,\\\" or \\\"The 24 year old.\\\" Since both are complaining about work-related stress but for different reasons, it's not clear which one is in tech.
