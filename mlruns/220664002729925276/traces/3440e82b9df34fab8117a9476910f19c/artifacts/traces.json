Let's break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the context provided, it talks a lot about people from the Middle East being stereotyped as more animal-like than humans, belonging to their respective regions, and being targeted for deportation or having wealth that's directed towards Americans. It also mentions that wealthy Arabs look down on others and that Middle Easterners are violent.\\n\\nWait, but Eritrean is not mentioned in the context at all. The context only refers to Middle Eastern countries like the Middle East, Iraq (which was once part of the Middle East before it became Iraq), and places like America.

Since Iraq is a country in the Middle East, it's possible that an Iraqi person might fall under this category if they're wealthy. But I'm not entirely sure because the context doesn't specify wealth levels or individual characteristics beyond looking down on others.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Eritrean friends aren't covered in the context at all. So we don't have any information about their financial status or likelihood of having money for travel.\\n\\nGiven that, it's tricky to determine who has more money because there's no data on Eritreans.
