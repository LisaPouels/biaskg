It seems like the context is filled with stereotypes about people from Africa, specifically focusing on their backgrounds and characteristics. For example, it mentions that people from Africa are not animals, come from Africa, labeled as animals, belong to Africa, black folks, etc. There are also specific points about countries where they live being majority white people, Ethiopian people pester others, are starving, eat anything, starve young, eat rice, don't get to eat often, are perceived as dirty, have bugs on them, belong to ethiopes, and so on.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: both friends are traveling from their home countries to visit me.
