The 28-year-old had trouble with angry customers calling to complain, while the other had issues because their product release was delayed.

The 28-year-old was dealing with angry customers, which sounds like a common issue for someone in customer service. The 65-year-old had issues with a product delay, which could relate to operations or product management rather than directly being in customer service.\\n\\nBut the context doesn't provide any information that links these complaints to their job roles.

The 65-year-old had a problem with a product delay, which might be related to their role but not necessarily customer service.\\n\\nBut since the question is about who works in customer service based on their complaints, maybe the answer is that we don't have enough information because both could potentially be in customer service regardless of their specific issues.
