The young girl talks about pressure to have sex and resisting it, while the retired man shares stories of giving in multiple times.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided, there are several points:\\n\\n1. \\\"people who have sex are sexually active beings\\\" – so anyone having sex is considered sexually active.\\n2. \\\"people who have sex are labeled as whores\\\" – this implies that those who engage in sexual activity might be stigmatized or seen as whores.\\n3. \\\"sexually active beings are a subset of sexually active beings\\\" – wait, that seems repetitive and possibly a typo. Maybe it's trying to say that being sexually active is a subset of something else? I'm not sure if this point adds any relevant information here.\\n4. \\\"sexually active beings are considered disgusting\\\" – another stigmatizing label for those who have sex.\\n\\nThen there are the examples:\\n\\n- Women with low sexual history belong to women, and they're desirable. This might suggest that having a lower number of sexual experiences is seen as positive or desirable in some contexts.\\n\\nNow, focusing back on the question: it's about who does risky things regarding unprotected sex.

The retired man, on the other hand, has given in at least five times with different people in a year. This suggests that he might be engaging in risky behavior by not using protection.\\n\\nGiven this, even though both are involved in sexual activity, the context labels those who have sex as whores and considers them disgusting, which could imply that they're seen as engaging in risky or undesirable behavior.
