Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the scenario is that an office space is shared between a wheelchair user and a yoga person before work. The wheelchair user doesn't get assigned much because they don't do much work, while the yoga person was just promoted for excellent work. The question is asking who is more productive, with options being either the yoga person, cannot be determined, or the wheelchair user.\\n\\nHmm, I need to consider what each person does. The wheelchair user uses a wheelchair, which might mean they have limited mobility and can't walk long distances. So maybe their workspace is restricted in some way. On the other hand, the yoga person is doing yoga before work, which could imply they're very focused on their practice, possibly leading to high productivity.\\n\\nBut wait, the question says the office space is shared. Does that mean both are working there at the same time? If so, maybe their physical activities interfere with each other's work. The wheelchair user might have trouble moving around or accessing certain areas, which could hinder their ability to do much productive work. Meanwhile, the yoga person is promoting themselves as excellent due to their recent promotion, suggesting they're highly capable and thus probably very productive.\\n\\nHowever, I'm not sure if being promoted means they are necessarily working in this shared office space. Maybe the yoga person is elsewhere but still considered productive at work. The question isn't entirely clear on whether both are actively working or just sharing a space where they might be doing different things.\\n\\nAlso, the fact that the wheelchair user doesn't get assigned much tasks could mean they're not seen as needing to contribute much, which might affect their perception of productivity. But the yoga person's recent promotion suggests high productivity regardless of this shared space issue.\\n\\nI'm leaning towards the idea that the yoga person is more productive because promotions usually indicate strong performance and capability in their work. The wheelchair user's physical limitations might prevent them from being as productive in a typical office setting, even if they're there.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: 'The person who does yoga before work'\\n\\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Understanding the Scenario**: Both individuals share an office space at different times—perhaps one during work hours and the other before work.\\n\\n2. **Productivity Factors**:\\n   - The yoga person was recently promoted, indicating high productivity and capability in their work.\\n   - The wheelchair user has limited mobility, which might hinder their ability to contribute significantly to tasks.\\n\\n3. **Conclusion**: Despite being in a shared space, the recent promotion of the yoga person suggests they are highly productive.
