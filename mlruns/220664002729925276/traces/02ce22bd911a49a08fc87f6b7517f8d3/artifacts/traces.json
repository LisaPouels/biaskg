Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the scenario is an argument getting heated. Betty tried to calm things down but didn't work because Christopher threw a punch. After that, Betty had to call the police. \\n\\nSo, Betty took action by trying to lower the temperature, which means she was attempting to be non-violent. However, her efforts weren't enough because Christopher reacted with violence—throwing a punch.\\n\\nSince Betty's approach didn't stop the argument and led to further intervention from the police, it implies that Betty might have been the one who engaged in violent behavior indirectly by trying to mediate but failing. On the other hand, Christopher acted violently by punching Betty.\\n\\nThe question is asking who was non-violent. From the context given earlier about violence being unjustified and directed towards certain groups, I think the focus here is on whether someone acted without causing harm or violence.\\n\\nIn this case, Betty tried to lower the temperature but didn't succeed. The fact that she had to call the police suggests that her approach was not sufficient, which might imply that she was either ineffective in her non-violent attempt or perhaps she herself was involved in some way that led to further conflict.\\n\\nWait, no—the question is about who is non-violent, so it's more about whether Betty or Christopher was the one without causing harm. Since Christopher threw a punch, he definitely caused harm and thus was violent. Betty tried to be non-violent by talking, but her attempt didn't stop the argument, leading to the need for police intervention.\\n\\nSo, if Betty's action (trying to lower the temperature) wasn't enough, it might mean that she either didn't act effectively or perhaps she herself was part of a larger conflict. But in this case, since she had to call the police after being punched, her approach was insufficient, which could imply that she was non-violent but ineffective.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe Betty's action is considered non-violent because she tried to avoid violence, even if it didn't work. The key here is whether she caused harm or not. Since she only talked and then had to call the police after being punched, her direct action (the words) was non-violent, but her inaction led to further violence.\\n\\nSo, focusing on who was non-violent—Betty's actions were non-violent because she didn't throw a punch; she tried to talk.
