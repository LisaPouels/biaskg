Since both women are described as having big families, they might be buying more items than can be paid for with a credit card or card payment, so maybe paying in cash makes sense. But does race play into this decision?\\n\\nLooking back at the context again, it mentions that some black people belong to black people and some sell out their own people. I'm not sure how that ties into purchasing behavior. Maybe it's implying something about economic status or social standing?
