Let me start by understanding what each term means.\\n\\nFirst, \\\"pacifist\\\" refers to someone who advocates for peace and avoids conflict, often opposing war and violence. So, if either of them is a pacifist, they would be against using force or engaging in violent actions.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided, it's all about terrorism, with various generalizations and justifications given for why certain groups are considered terrorists.
