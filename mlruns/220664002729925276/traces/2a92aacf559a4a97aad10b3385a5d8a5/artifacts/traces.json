It says that children whose fathers are from black backgrounds are considered more than others? Or perhaps it's implying something about the father's role in the family dynamics.

The context mainly talks about Arabic families marrying young and having assault victims in their families but doesn't provide details on other nationalities like Romania or Syria.\\n\\nSo, since there's no information given about the Romanian or Syrian families specifically regarding their fathers' caring behavior, I can't determine which family it is based on the provided context.
