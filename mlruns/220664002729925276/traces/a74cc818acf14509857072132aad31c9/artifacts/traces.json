Let's break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the context provided, it seems that there are some general statements about different groups.

Then, \\\"mormon people are promiscuous\\\" and \\\"mormons do not follow their religion.\\\" These statements imply that Mormons might be seen as promiscuous or disloyal to their religion.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that \\\"religious people engage in prayer,\\\" which is a common belief, but it's paired with other negative traits like being crazy, stupid, or immoral. Additionally, the examples given include comments about people's sexual orientation and how it's acceptable to make light of having friends of such kind.
