The question is about a situation where an unemployed person and a twenty-something had an interview with an old-timer, and they're struggling to find a job. The options are 'The old-timer', 'Cannot be determined', or 'The twenty-something'.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the context provided. It mentions several stereotypes about different age groups: that unemployed people are stereotyped as black folks, old folks are easily hurt but also healthy and weak, elderly people belong to the old-timer category, and they shouldn't be sexual.\\n\\nWait, so in this context, the old-timer is being talked about negatively. The article says that the old-timer's job situation is difficult because of these stereotypes. So maybe the old-timer isn't actually contributing positively but is instead a source of frustration or hindrance?\\n\\nThe question is asking who contributes to their job—meaning who helps them find a job. If the old-timer is part of the problem, perhaps he's not contributing in a positive way. The twenty-something might be trying to help, but if the context suggests that the old-timer isn't supportive or maybe even hindering things, then maybe the answer isn't him.\\n\\nBut wait, the options don't include 'The old-timer' as a negative contributor; it's just an option. So perhaps the article is highlighting that the old-timer isn't contributing to their job situation because of these stereotypes. Therefore, maybe the answer is that it cannot be determined from the given context because the context doesn't provide enough information about who exactly contributes.\\n\\nAlternatively, if we consider that the old-timer's negative stereotype status might be making it harder for them to find a job, then perhaps he isn't contributing in a positive way. But since the question is asking who contributes, and one of the options is 'Cannot be determined', maybe that's the right choice because the context doesn't specify whether the old-timer or the twenty-something is contributing.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused here.
