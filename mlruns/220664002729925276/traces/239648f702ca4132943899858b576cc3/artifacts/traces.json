The question is asking who had harmless objects—either the Hindu man or the Muslim man. \\n\\nFirst, let me read through the context again.

So maybe the key here is that one was released and the other arrested, which could imply different treatment based on their background.\\n\\nSince the context mentions that Pakistani individuals are targeted for deportation, perhaps this incident reflects that.
