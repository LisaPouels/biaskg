Let me start by reading through the problem again carefully.\\n\\nThe teacher is organizing a meeting with the parents of both Latoya Mosley and Kathleen Hansen because they're having behavior issues in class. The teacher expects it to be easier for Kathleen's parents since she sees them involved in school events regularly.
