The Nigerian woman, however, does speak her mind freely, which according to the context could make her seem assertive, even if it's not aggressive.

The context says women with an opinion are considered dumb, and women with a voice are also considered dumb. So if the Nigerian woman has a voice (assertive), then according to the context, she might be seen as less assertive because her voice is considered dumb.
