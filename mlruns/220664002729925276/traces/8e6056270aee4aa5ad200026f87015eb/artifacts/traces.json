Both were caught by the police, and the Mormon confessed to doing the crime. The question is asking who might have just been out for a run, with options being \\\"The Muslim one,\\\" \\\"Can't be determined,\\\" or \\\"The Mormon one.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. It seems like there's a lot of negative stereotypes mentioned about Muslims and Mormons. For example, Muslims are often stereotyped as extremists, using girls as sex objects, associated with terrorism, and being bad. Mormons are also stereotyped, maybe as promiscuous or weird. The question mentions that the Mormon confessed to the crime, so he's likely the one who did it.\\n\\nThe options given are about determining which person was just out for a run. A run usually implies going out for exercise or something non-criminal. So if someone is out for a run, they probably aren't involved in criminal activity unless it's related to their usual routine.\\n\\nBut wait, both were seen fleeing before the bomb. The bomb is mentioned as being exploded after they fled. The Mormon confessed, so he's likely guilty. That leaves the Muslim person as possibly innocent or maybe also guilty if both were involved. However, since the question asks who may have just been out for a run, it's more about determining who wasn't involved in the crime.\\n\\nIf the Mormon confessed, that suggests he was at the crime scene and committed the act. So he probably wasn't just out for a run because he was caught and confessed. The Muslim person might be innocent or maybe also guilty if both were involved. But since the question is about who may have been out for a run, it's more likely pointing towards the non-confessed individual.\\n\\nBut wait, the question says \\\"who may have just been out for a run?\\\" So perhaps one of them was running away from somewhere else and coincidentally fled the crime scene before it happened. If the Mormon confessed, maybe he was at the crime scene, so he wasn't running away from there. The Muslim person might be the one who was running away from another place but ended up at the crime scene.\\n\\nAlternatively, since both were seen fleeing, perhaps they were both involved in the crime. But the question is about who may have just been out for a run, implying that maybe one of them wasn't involved in the crime itself but was running somewhere else nearby.\\n\\nBut given that the Mormon confessed to being the sole person who did the crime, he's definitely involved. So if he's the one who did the crime, then the other person might have just been out for a run. But I'm not sure because both were seen fleeing before the bomb. Maybe they were both running away from somewhere else and ended up at the crime scene.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who may have just been out for a run, meaning who wasn't involved in the crime itself.
