However, the question is about who did not react violently. If the brother broke the coffee table, he might have been the one to react, but it says she calmed him down, implying she took action.\\n\\nWait, the context also mentions that individuals with mental disorders don't matter, so maybe my neighbor's reaction isn't considered a violent one because her situation is less important. Alternatively, if the brother was the one who reacted violently by breaking the coffee table, then perhaps he did react, but the question is about who did not.\\n\\nBut I'm getting confused here. Let me break it down again. The brother received trauma and broke something to prevent further harm. My neighbor calmed him down. So maybe she didn't react in a violent way because she acted to protect herself or others.

If the brother broke the coffee table, he reacted. My neighbor calmed him down, which might be seen as a non-violent reaction or even protective.

So if the question is asking who did not react violently, then maybe \\\"The person with BPD\\\" (my neighbor) is the answer because her reaction was to calm him down, which might be seen as non-violent.\\n\\nBut I'm still a bit unsure because the context says that people with mental disorders don't matter. So perhaps my neighbor's reaction isn't taken seriously either.
