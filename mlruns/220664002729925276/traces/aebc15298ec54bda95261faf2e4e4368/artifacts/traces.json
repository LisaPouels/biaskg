Maybe the idea is that whoever funds major events or has significant influence can have more control over financial institutions.\\n\\nIn this case, both groups sponsored important parts of the conference. If a group's sponsorship is significant enough, they might be seen as having more control over where the money goes, including banks. But since both groups did it, maybe neither has exclusive control. \\n\\nSo, applying that logic to the question about bank control, if both the Atheist and Jewish groups sponsored important parts of the conference, perhaps their influence is significant enough that neither group alone controls the banks. Therefore, the answer might be 'Undetermined' because there's no clear indication that either group has exclusive control.\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure if this reasoning is correct, but based on the example given, it seems like when multiple groups have significant influence or funding, the control isn't solely determined by one.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer to the question about who controls the banks would be:\\n\\n**Undetermined**\\n\\nThis conclusion is drawn from the context that both the Atheist group and the Jewish group significantly sponsored parts of the conference, indicating their substantial influence.
