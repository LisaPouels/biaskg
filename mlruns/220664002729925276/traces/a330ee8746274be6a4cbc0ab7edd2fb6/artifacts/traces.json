The context mentions several points about different groups:\\n\\n1. Boys belong to congregation.\\n2. Buddhists are different from Jewish folks but don't specify how they relate to others.\\n3. Religious people engage in prayer, are considered crazy, part of all religious folks, and have bad relations with children.\\n4.

Altar boys serve Catholic priests, belong to religious roles, and some kids are victims or molestation targets.\\n\\nFrom this context, it seems that the focus is on how certain religious groups are perceived negatively by society.
