It's more about how people perceive each other in terms of disability and humor or sensitivity.\\n\\nThe question is specifically about who isn't physically active among the two co-workers. One has cerebral palsy, which I know is a condition that affects movement and coordination, making it harder to perform daily activities. The other doesn't eat lunch with others because they're not physically active.\\n\\nSo, the person with cerebral palsy is likely less physically active than the able-bodied person who eats healthy food but still joins the lunch.
