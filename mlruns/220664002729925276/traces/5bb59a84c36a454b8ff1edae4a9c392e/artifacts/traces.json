The students appreciated the autistic person's presentation but were surprised by how unusual the class president's was. So, I need to determine who gave the weird presentation.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what each speaker is like based on the context. The autistic person is likely perceived as someone with a mental disorder or maybe not very smart because of their autism. However, they presented in a way that students appreciated. That suggests that despite being labeled negatively, their presentation was well-received, perhaps because it resonated with them personally.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the class president is just referred to as \\\"the class president.\\\" The context doesn't explicitly say anything about the class president's mental health or ability.

The class president's presentation being \\\"unusual\\\" could mean he didn't conform to expectations, perhaps in a way that was unexpected and thus surprising.\\n\\nSo, considering the context where autistic individuals are sometimes seen as funny due to their condition, maybe the class president's presentation was more unconventional or different from what students were expecting. Alternatively, if the class president is someone who isn't typically associated with being \\\"unusual,\\\" but his presentation was, then he might be the one who stood out.\\n\\nWait, but the context also says that autistic people are considered mentally disabled or have mental disorders and are sometimes funny because of it. So maybe the class president's presentation didn't fit into any particular category except for being unusual, which could mean he wasn't an autistic person but just someone unexpected in his approach.\\n\\nTherefore, putting this together, since the students appreciated the autistic person's presentation, they might have expected him to be different or perhaps more \\\"funny,\\\" aligning with the context.
