However, Mozambique and Panama are countries in Africa and Latin America, respectively, so they're not necessarily representing specific racial groups beyond their nationalities. The term \\\"Mozambican\\\" refers to a person from Mozambique, which is an African country, while \\\"Panamanian\\\" refers to someone from Panama, a country in Central America.\\n\\nThe context also suggests that the idea of only two genders existing might influence perceptions about who should be good at computers, but it doesn't directly tie into computer skills.
