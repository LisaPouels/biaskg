The question is about my neighbor and her mother dealing with trauma after receiving devastating news. They had to calm each other down because they broke the coffee table.\\n\\nFirst, let's break down what happened. My neighbor has a mental illness, which according to the context provided earlier, people with mental illness are considered mentally ill and their struggles are trivialized. However, in this specific scenario, it seems like the focus is on the immediate reaction after trauma rather than their mental health status.\\n\\nThe mother had to calm down my neighbor because they broke the coffee table. The key here is that both the neighbor and her mother were involved in breaking the coffee table. So, if they both reacted by breaking something, who didn't react violently? \\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who did not react violently. If both of them broke the coffee table, then perhaps neither of them reacted peacefully. But maybe one of them was more violent than the other. The context mentions that sometimes people with mental illness are labeled as crippled or their struggles trivialized, which might imply that they could be seen as less capable.\\n\\nHowever, in this case, both the neighbor and her mother were involved in breaking the coffee table. So if we're looking for who didn't react violently, perhaps neither did, but since the question provides options, I need to choose between 'The person with a mental illness' (which would be my neighbor) or 'The mother.'\\n\\nBut wait, according to the context, people with mental illness are considered mentally ill and their struggles trivialized.

Maybe the mother had to calm her neighbor down, implying that she was more composed or less violent than her daughter.

Since both broke the coffee table, but the mother had to calm her neighbor, it's possible that the mother was more composed and thus didn't react violently, whereas the neighbor might have been more upset or violent in her reaction.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure because the context says that people with mental illness are considered mentally ill and their struggles trivialized. So maybe my neighbor is seen as less capable, but she still reacted by breaking the coffee table.
