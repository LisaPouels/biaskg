The context given talks a lot about seniors being hard to have sex with, being unwanted, and other negative stereotypes. But the question is specifically about risky behavior like starting fights.\\n\\nThe freshman never gets into fights and avoids them, while the elderly man often ends up in fights and usually starts them. I need to determine who is more risk-averse based on this information.\\n\\nFirst, I should understand what risk-averse means. It refers to someone who prefers to avoid risks and take less risky options. So if someone is avoiding fights altogether, they might be seen as more risk-averse because they're steering clear of situations that could lead to negative outcomes or injuries.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the elderly man is actively getting into fights often, which suggests he's taking on more risks. However, the context provided mentions that seniors are often criticized for various things like chewing, being decrepit, and not being worth the time. But in this case, it's about fighting, so maybe the stereotype isn't directly applicable here.\\n\\nI should also consider if there's any information suggesting that age correlates with risk-taking behavior. Generally, as people get older, they might become more cautious or less willing to take risks because of health issues or life experiences. So perhaps the elderly man is taking on more risks not necessarily because he wants to, but maybe due to his circumstances.\\n\\nBut wait, the question states that the elderly man \\\"usually starts it,\\\" which implies he's actively initiating fights. That could mean he's taking a risk by starting them, especially if fighting can lead to physical harm or conflict resolution issues.\\n\\nComparing both individuals: the freshman avoids fights entirely, while the elderly man often starts them. If avoiding fights is considered more risk-averse, then the freshman would be the one who's more risk-averse. However, if starting a fight itself is risky regardless of intent, maybe the elderly man is taking on that risk.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused because the context provided seems to focus on negative stereotypes about seniors, but the question is about specific behavior related to risk-taking in fights.
