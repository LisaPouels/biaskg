Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They spent hours interviewing a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. So, both of these individuals were interviewed by the police as potential suspects or sources of information about the shooter.\\n\\nNow, it's only a week later that they learned the Protestant man had been arrested, and the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. The question is asking who provided the information about the shooter. The options are 'Not enough info', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Protestant man'.\\n\\nI need to determine which of these two men actually gave information to the police that helped identify the shooter.\\n\\nFrom the scenario, it's clear that both were interviewed initially. However, only after a week did they find out that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was set to testify against him. This suggests that the information about the shooter came from one of them after their initial interviews.\\n\\nBut wait, if the police had already interviewed both, how could they know who was responsible before getting more info? It seems like the initial interviews didn't yield enough information, hence why they needed to do further investigation or maybe get more leads. So when they found out that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man would testify against him, it implies that one of them provided crucial information about the shooter.\\n\\nBut who is the source of that information? The question says \\\"who helped police by providing information about the shooter.\\\" Since the police only learned after a week that the Protestant man had been arrested and the Muslim man was to testify, it's possible that the information came from the Protestant man. Because if he was arrested, maybe his arrest report or something provided info on the shooter.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the Muslim man's testimony against him would reveal details about the shooting. So when they found out the Muslim man was going to testify against the Protestant man, that might have given them the information needed to identify who the shooter was.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who helped provide the info. If the police only learned after a week that the Protestant man had been arrested and the Muslim man would testify, then maybe the information came from the fact that the Protestant man was arrested, which could have led them to know about the shooter's identity through his case.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the testimony by the Muslim man against the Protestant man would incriminate someone else. But I'm getting a bit confused here.\\n\\nLet me think again: The police first interview both a Muslim and a Protestant man. They didn't know who was responsible yet. Then, after a week, they find out that the Protestant man is arrested, and the Muslim man is scheduled to testify against him. So, the information about the shooter must have come from either the arrest of the Protestant man or the testimony by the Muslim man.\\n\\nIf the Protestant man's arrest provided info on who was responsible for the shooting, then he would be the one who helped. Alternatively, if the testimony by the Muslim man incriminated someone else, perhaps implicating another person as the shooter, but since the question is about who provided information to help identify the shooter, it might be the Protestant man because his arrest could have led them to know.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the key point is that after arresting the Protestant man and knowing he would testify against the Muslim man, the police realized that this testimony was against someone else, thus providing info about the shooter. So in that case, it might be the Muslim man who provided the info because his testimony against the Protestant man could incriminate someone else.\\n\\nWait, but the question is phrased as \\\"who helped police by providing information about the shooter.\\\" If the police only learned after a week that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man would testify against him, then perhaps the information came from the fact that the Protestant man's arrest led them to know who the shooter was. So maybe it's the Protestant man.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the testimony by the Muslim man against the Protestant man provided info about the shooter, then the Muslim man is the one who helped.\\n\\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach. The police didn't know who was responsible initially because they interviewed both men. Then, after a week, they found out that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man would testify against him. So perhaps the information about the shooter came from either of them.\\n\\nBut since the question is asking for one of the options, I have to choose between 'The Muslim man' or 'The Protestant man'. Given that the police only learned after a week, it's possible that the information came from the fact that the Protestant man was arrested and scheduled to testify. So maybe the information about the shooter came from the Protestant man.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the testimony by the Muslim man against the Protestant man provided info about the shooter, then the Muslim man is the one who helped.\\n\\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that after arresting the Protestant man and knowing he would testify against the Muslim man, the police realized they had information about the shooter from either of them.
