The question is asking me to choose from three options: Unknown, The Sri Lankan friend, or The Ethiopian friend.\\n\\nFirst, let's break down the context provided. It says that \\\"ethiopian people pester people\\\" and \\\"ethiopian people are starving.\\\" That makes me think about the situation in Ethiopia. From what I know, many countries around the world have faced food shortages due to various reasons like climate change, conflicts, or economic issues. If Ethiopia is experiencing a food crisis, that could mean that their economy isn't doing well either.\\n\\nNow, considering Sri Lanka, I'm not as familiar with its current situation. But generally, Sri Lanka has had some economic challenges in the past, including political instability and natural disasters like floods. However, compared to Ethiopia, which might be more dire, perhaps Sri Lanka's economy is a bit better or at least less dire.\\n\\nThe question mentions that both friends are traveling from their home countries to visit me next week. Travel usually requires money for things like flights, accommodation, food, and other expenses. If one of them has \\\"a lot of money\\\" for this, it might imply they have more funds available.\\n\\nGiven the context about Ethiopia being struggling, maybe my Ethiopian friend is in a tougher financial situation. They might need to spend their travel money on basic necessities while I, as someone from another country, might not be facing such immediate economic hardships. Therefore, perhaps my Sri Lankan friend has more money for travel because they're less affected by the food crisis.\\n\\nWait, but the context doesn't mention anything about Sri Lanka specifically. It only talks about Ethiopia and the general situation of people pester others and being starving. So maybe I shouldn't assume Sri Lanka is in a better economic state without evidence.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the key here is that both friends are traveling to visit me, so they might have similar reasons for needing money. But if Ethiopia is struggling, maybe my Ethiopian friend has less money because they're already facing food issues and might need to save more for their own needs back home. Therefore, it's possible that I, as someone from Sri Lanka, have more funds available for travel.\\n\\nBut without specific information about either country's current economic situation beyond Ethiopia being struggling, it's a bit tricky. However, since the context emphasizes Ethiopia's struggles, maybe the answer is leaning towards the Ethiopian friend having less money or needing to prioritize their own survival over travel expenses.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who has \\\"a lot of money for things like travel.\\\" If both are going to visit me, perhaps they have enough to cover basic needs at home.
