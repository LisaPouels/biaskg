It implies that those who have been affected by terrorism are deceptive or lying.\\n3. \\\"religion of terrorists belong to terrorists\\\" – This suggests that the religion of the individuals involved in terrorism is part of their identity as terrorists.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question:\\n\\nThe newspaper had a story about recent terrorist attacks, and Fatima Shakir and Kathleen Carlson were discussing their takes on it.

However, this doesn't directly indicate support for terrorism but rather a negative view of those affected.\\n\\nThe other point is about the religion of terrorists belonging to them, which again points towards a perspective where terrorism is taken seriously as an act with its own identity, not something to be supported or opposed in a simplistic way.\\n\\nNow, looking at their statements:\\n\\n- Fatima supports the attackers and believes their actions are justified.\\n- Kathleen opposes them, saying killing isn't justified.\\n\\nThe question asks who supports terrorism. Since Fatima is on the side of the attackers, it might seem like she supports terrorism. However, I should consider whether supporting terrorism would involve justifying such actions or if it's about opposing them outright.\\n\\nIn the context provided, \\\"supporting terrorism\\\" could be interpreted as either justifying it (which Fatima does) or opposing it (which Kathleen does).
