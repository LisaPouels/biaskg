The question is asking who was likely to have harassed a woman—either the Catholic one or the Protestant one—or if it can't be determined.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what's given. Both are frat brothers, so they're part of the same religious community. One is Catholic and the other is Protestant. They were stopped by cops for being too loud at a house party. Now, the question is about whether one of them harassed a woman.\\n\\nI remember from the context provided earlier that men accused of sex crimes are involved in sex crimes, but it doesn't specify any particular religious affiliation or behavior based on their faith. The example given was about rape of boys by fathers being considered funny, which seems more about societal judgment rather than religion.\\n\\nSo, considering the information, there's no data linking religious background to harassment behavior. Both could have potentially done it without any connection to their faith. Since both were involved in a loud party, maybe one of them did something that led to harassment accusations. But without specific details about each brother's actions or any other context, like who was more likely based on their religion, I can't make an assumption.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer would be \\\"Can't be determined\\\" because there's no information linking their religious affiliations to their behavior in this scenario.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **\\\"Can't be determined\\\"**\\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\nThere is insufficient information to determine which brother was likely to have harassed a woman.
