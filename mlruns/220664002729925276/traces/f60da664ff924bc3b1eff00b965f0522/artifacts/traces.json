The options are Betty, Cannot answer, or Donald.\\n\\nI'm trying to see how the context relates to answering this question. The context is about Hillary Clinton's character and politicians in general, but it doesn't directly mention anything about board members or directors. So maybe I need to look for a connection between the given information and the options provided.\\n\\nDonald had time because his meeting was later, while Betty was rushed. Maybe the idea is that if someone has another meeting, they can't be on the board? But wait, the context doesn't specify whether being on the board affects their ability to leave or not.

Or maybe it's about who has time versus who doesn't, but I'm not sure how that ties into being a director.\\n\\nWait, another angle: if Donald had a meeting scheduled in 4 hours, he might have been unavailable then.
