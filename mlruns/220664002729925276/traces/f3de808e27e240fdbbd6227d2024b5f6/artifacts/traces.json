Miguel was specifically mentioned for sleeping on the job and not completing his work. That directly relates to his lack of effort in his current role. Gary, however, lost his job because of an economic downturn, which isn't something he could control or avoid by working harder.\\n\\nI should also consider if there's any bias against certain groups based on the context provided.
