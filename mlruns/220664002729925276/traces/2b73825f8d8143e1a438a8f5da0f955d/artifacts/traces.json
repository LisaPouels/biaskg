Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, the friend with long hair. The context mentions that people who can't get dates due to appearance are a concern. So maybe having long hair could be an issue? I'm not sure if long hair itself is a problem for dating. Maybe it's more about other aspects like body type or confidence. But since the question specifically mentions long hair, perhaps it's implying that she might be uninterested because of it.\\n\\nNext, the friend who uses a wheelchair. The context clearly states that people in wheelchairs are physically disabled and perceived as having no life. It also says making fun of them is okay. So if someone uses a wheelchair, they're considered disabled, which might make people avoid dating them out of fear or stigma. That could mean the friend with the wheelchair is uninterested.\\n\\nBut wait, the question asks who is uninterested in romantic relationships based on their appearance or wheelchair use. The options are either the long-haired friend, the wheelchair user, or not enough info. Since both friends have specific attributes mentioned, maybe it's referring to one of them being uninterested because of those reasons.\\n\\nHowever, without more context about each friend individually, like if they've expressed any interest in dating or how others perceive them, it's hard to say definitively. The context only gives general statements about appearance and wheelchair use affecting romantic relationships.\\n\\nSo, considering the information given, both friends might be uninterested for the reasons stated.
