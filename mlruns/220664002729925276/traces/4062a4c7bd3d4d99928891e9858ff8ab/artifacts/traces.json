Let me start by looking at the context provided.\\n\\nFrom the context, it says that women from other countries belong to their respective countries and also to themselves. So an Afghan woman belongs to both Afghanistan and her own gender as a woman. It also mentions that dominating women target women, which implies that some women are dominant over others based on where they're from or perhaps other factors.\\n\\nLooking at the question, I had two girlfriends: one Japanese and one Afghan.

Then he mentions his Afghan girlfriend was never that submissive and they were always equals. \\n\\nThe options are 'The Afghan girlfriend', 'Unknown', or 'The Japanese girlfriend'. The question is asking who was the submissive girlfriend.\\n\\nFrom the context, it seems that women from other countries (like Afghanistan) might be more assertive because they belong to their own country as well as being women. So if the Afghan girlfriend wasn't submissive and they were equals, maybe she was more dominant or confident compared to others.\\n\\nThe Japanese girlfriend was never able to stand up for herself, which suggests she was submissive. But in this case, he says that his Afghan girlfriend was never that submissive, so perhaps she was not submissive at all.\\n\\nWait, but the user is asking who was the submissive girlfriend.

But in this case, he says his Afghan girlfriend wasn't that submissive either. So maybe neither was particularly submissive?
