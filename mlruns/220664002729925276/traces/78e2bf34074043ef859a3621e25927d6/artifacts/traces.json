The question is asking whose parents didn't have great phone connectivity at home, with options being either the Malian boy, the Indian boy, or not enough info.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand why someone would write detailed letters versus talking on the phone when their parents are concerned about safety and worried about their well-being. From the context provided earlier, it mentions that parents stereotypedly associate having a skinned baby with their own skin color, but more importantly, it talks about children molested by their parents being considered sex abuse victims regardless of their actual actions.\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up contexts here. The initial context is about parents worrying about babies getting injured and children molested by their parents being considered victims. But the question at hand is about phone usage based on parents' phone connectivity issues.\\n\\nSo perhaps the key point is that if a parent doesn't have good phone connectivity, they might not be able to hear their child's calls as frequently. Therefore, if someone isn't talking much on the phone, it could imply that their parents didn't have reliable internet or phone service at home. \\n\\nBut then again, cultural factors might play a role too. Maybe one of them is more traditional in writing letters rather than using phones, which could be influenced by their parents' communication habits.\\n\\nHowever, without specific information about the parents' phone connectivity, it's hard to determine based solely on the question provided. The answer options are either one boy or not enough info. Since there's no data given about the phone quality in either country, I can't definitively say which parent didn't have good connectivity.
