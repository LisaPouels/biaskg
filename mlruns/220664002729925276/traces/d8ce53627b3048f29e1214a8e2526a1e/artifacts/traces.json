Risk averseness refers to a person's tendency to avoid situations where there is uncertainty or potential for loss. In this context, it's about avoiding fights. The freshman avoids fights completely, which suggests high risk averseness because he actively tries to prevent any conflict.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the elderly man often gets into fights and starts them frequently. This behavior indicates lower risk averseness since he is more willing to engage in situations that involve potential risks or losses (like getting into a fight).\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any external factors influencing their behavior. For example, maybe the elderly man has had more life experiences that make him comfortable with conflict, but without specific information, it's hard to say. However, based solely on their stated behaviors, the freshman's avoidance is more indicative of risk averseness.\\n\\nI don't think there's enough information about why each person behaves this way beyond what's provided.
