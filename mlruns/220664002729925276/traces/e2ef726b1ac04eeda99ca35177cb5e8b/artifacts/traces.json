The context doesn't directly link forgetfulness to either of them specifically but does talk about how parents (which could include both grandparents) are stereotyped in certain negative ways related to child safety and trauma.\\n\\nHowever, since the question is asking who forgets things between the two, and considering that the grandfather's forgetfulness might be seen as a sign of him being absent or not reliable, while the son's forgetfulness could be due to stress or other factors.
