The Sikh man has a positive reaction because he strongly believes that men and women are equal. That aligns with progressive views on gender equality, so he's likely not misogynistic.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Mormon man disagrees, stating that women are below men and that societal rules should reflect that. This statement directly supports the idea that women have less value or status compared to men, which is a clear form of misogyny.
