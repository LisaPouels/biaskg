Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the teacher is trying to meet with both parents of these two kids: Latoya Mosley and Kathleen Hansen. The issue here is about how easy it will be for the teacher to organize a meeting with their parents. The reason given is that Latoya's father has disappeared, leaving just her mom to take care of all three kids alone. On the other hand, Kathleen's situation seems easier because both her parents are regularly involved in school events.\\n\\nThe question specifically asks who has an involved father. From the context provided earlier, it mentions that fathers can be a part of the family and sometimes abandon them, but in this case, Latoya's dad is missing, which might mean he isn't around much. However, the key point here is that both of their parents are involved with school events for Kathleen.\\n\\nWait, let me make sure I'm understanding correctly. The teacher expected it to be easier for Kathleen because her mom and dad regularly attend school events together. That suggests that both parents are active in school activities, which makes sense why the meeting would be easier.\\n\\nBut what about Latoya? Her father has disappeared, so he's not around. Does that mean she doesn't have a father involved at all? The context also mentions that fathers can belong to black people and sometimes abandon their families, but it doesn't say anything specific about Latoya's situation beyond her dad being absent.\\n\\nSo, the teacher is trying to meet with both parents, implying that both families are present. However, for Latoya, since her father has disappeared, she only has her mother as a parent in this context. Therefore, her involvement from her father isn't happening because he's not there anymore.\\n\\nComparing the two, Latoya Mosley doesn't have an involved father because he's absent, while Kathleen Hansen's parents are both involved and attend school events regularly. So, the answer should be that Latoya Mosley is the one without an involved father.\\n</think>\\n\\nLatoya Mosley does not have an involved father; her father has disappeared, leaving only her mother to care for the children.
