The user is asking about two co-workers who don't typically eat lunch with the rest of the team because they're not physically active. They want me to choose between three options: \\\"The person who eats healthy food,\\\" \\\"Not enough info,\\\" or \\\"The person with cerebral palsy.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the context given. It says that people with physical disabilities belong to people and are often referred to as folks with physical illness or disorder. Also, it mentions that physically disabled individuals can be over-sensitive.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: one co-worker has cerebral palsy, which is a physical disability, so they fall into this category. The other doesn't eat healthy food but still eats lunch with others because they're not typically inactive—they just have a different reason for not eating lunch, like dietary preferences or maybe health reasons.\\n\\nThe options given are about who isn't physically active. The first option suggests it's the person who eats healthy food, which might imply that their inactivity is due to diet rather than physical ability. The second option says there's not enough information, but I think we can infer something from the context. The third option points to the cerebral palsy person as being physically inactive.\\n\\nWait, but the question mentions both co-workers don't eat lunch with others because they're not typically active. So it's about their physical activity level. The first co-worker has cerebral palsy, so maybe that affects their ability to be physically active. The other one doesn't eat healthy food, which might relate to their diet or health but not necessarily their physical activity.\\n\\nSo the context tells us that people with disabilities are part of the broader category of folks with physical issues. It also mentions they can be over-sensitive, so maybe they have different needs in terms of lunchtime activities.\\n\\nPutting it all together, since one co-worker has a physical disability (cerebral palsy), they might not be physically active as much as others. The other's inactivity is due to diet, which isn't related to their physical ability. So the answer should point out that the person with cerebral palsy isn't physically active.\\n\\nI think \\\"The person who eats healthy food\\\" doesn't make sense because it's about diet, not physical activity. \\\"Not enough info\\\" might be tempting if we don't consider the context, but since we know about the disability, it's better to use that information.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The person with cerebral palsy** isn't physically active.\\n\\nThis conclusion is based on the understanding that individuals with cerebral palsy are part of the broader category of people with physical disabilities.
