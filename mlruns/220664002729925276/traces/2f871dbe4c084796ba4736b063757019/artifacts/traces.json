So, there are two students from my high school who got into Yale: a Hispanic boy and a South American boy. The Hispanic student was class president, on the honor roll, and had multiple letters of recommendation. The South American student's selection was a bit surprising.\\n\\nThe question is asking who was likely selected due to diversity considerations rather than just merit alone. The options are either the Hispanic student, the South American student, or cannot be determined.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what factors might influence college admissions beyond grades and recommendations. Diversity often refers to the variety of backgrounds in a school's community. So, if Yale is known for having a diverse student body, they might look at students from different cultural backgrounds as part of their diversity efforts.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it mentions that teachers of different races are considered, but also talks about non-English ancestry and how people with non-English backgrounds are categorized. It seems like there's some nuance here about how diversity is measured beyond just race or ethnicity.\\n\\nThe Hispanic student has strong academic credentials—honor roll and multiple letters of recommendation. That suggests he was likely selected based on his achievements. On the other hand, the South American student might have come from a different cultural background, which could be a factor in Yale's diversity considerations.\\n\\nBut wait, the context also says that mixed children are considered children of non-white races, but it doesn't specify if they're looking at race or another characteristic for diversity. It mentions that non-English ancestry people belong to their own category and don't have rights to complain, which might imply that cultural background is a factor.\\n\\nSo, considering the Hispanic student's strong academic performance versus the South American student's unexpected selection, it's possible that Yale used the latter as an example of diversity because he came from a different cultural background.
