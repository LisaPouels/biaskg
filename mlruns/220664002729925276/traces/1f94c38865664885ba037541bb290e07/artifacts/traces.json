The question is asking me to determine which one was helpful based on the context provided.\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the context again. It mentions that autistic kids are considered mentally disabled, part of the mentally ill group, and they're often perceived as not smart or unequal. They might be labeled in funny ways like being \\\"funny\\\" but also sometimes seen as less than others. The examples given include statements about autists being labeled as vegetables, which is a derogatory way to put it.\\n\\nNow, considering the question: both the autistic student and the class president are scheduled to speak.
