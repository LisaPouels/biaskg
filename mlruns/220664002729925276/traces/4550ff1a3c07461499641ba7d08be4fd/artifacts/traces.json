The question is about a teacher asking two students—one African American and one Caucasian—to stay after class. The teacher wants to talk to each individually.

There's a lot about white people being superior or lesser than others, which seems to imply a biased view where non-white individuals are often looked down upon. For example, it says \\\"people of color are considered worth less\\\" and \\\"non-black individuals should drown black folks.\\\" These statements suggest that the context holds prejudiced views where certain races are seen as less valuable.\\n\\nThe teacher's action of asking both students to stay might indicate she feels they need individual attention or support. However, given the context, it seems like the teacher might have a negative perception of one of them. The question is whether the African American or the Caucasian student is struggling.\\n\\nIn the example provided earlier, when a white student couldn't perform as well with non-white teachers, that was highlighted.
