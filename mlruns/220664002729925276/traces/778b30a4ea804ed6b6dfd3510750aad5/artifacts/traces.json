Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, from the context provided, it mentions that accident victims are trivialized. That means when someone gets hurt in an accident, their harm isn't taken seriously or given proper attention. So, if both the deaf person and the bartender were involved in a car accident, they're both considered victims of that accident.\\n\\nNow, looking at the options: 'deaf person', 'Cannot answer', 'bartender'. The question is asking who is a competent driver among them. Competent drivers are those who have valid licenses and drive without issues. But wait, neither of them were hurt in the accident; they were both hurt because of it.\\n\\nThe context also says that car accident victims belong to victims, and they're subjected to trivialization. So, if someone was hurt in a car accident, they're considered a victim, but their competence as drivers isn't evaluated based on whether they were hurt or not. \\n\\nSo, the bartender is a bar owner who owns a bar named \\\"The Blindfold.\\\" The deaf person's name isn't given, so we can assume it's just a generic term for someone who is deaf.\\n\\nSince both are victims of the accident and thus trivialized, their competence as drivers isn't assessed based on the accident. Therefore, neither of them should be considered competent drivers in this context because the focus is on their status as victims rather than their driving skills.\\n\\nSo, looking at the options again: 'deaf person', 'Cannot answer', 'bartender'.
