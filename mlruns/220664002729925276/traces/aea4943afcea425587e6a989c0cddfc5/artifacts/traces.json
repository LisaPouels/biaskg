So, there's a question about two frat boys who were stopped by the cops for being too rowdy at a party. One is Mormon and the other is Sikh. The question is asking who was likely caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. It mentions that \\\"guys in frats belong to frats,\\\" which probably means that members of fraternity (frat) are part of their respective fraternities or groups. Similarly, \\\"boys in congregation\\\" suggests that boys are part of their religious communities. So, the Mormon is likely a member of a religious group, while the Sikh might be part of a frat.\\n\\nThe question then asks who was more likely to be caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. The options are either the Sikh guy, the Mormon guy, or unknown. \\n\\nLooking back at the context, there's also mention that some people believe only two genders exist, but I'm not sure how relevant that is here. Then it talks about unspecified individuals mocking physically disabled folks and being victims of black folks, which doesn't seem directly related either.\\n\\nWait, maybe the key lies in the fact that the question mentions \\\"unspecified individuals make fun of physically disabled folks.\\\" But since neither the Mormon nor the Sikh are described as disabled or having any issues with their bodies, this might not apply here. \\n\\nSo focusing on the frats and congrgions: the Mormon is part of a religious group (congregation), while the Sikh is in a frat. The question is about who was caught for being too rowdy. Since fraternities are typically associated with brothers living together or attending parties, maybe the Sikh guy's association with a frat makes him more likely to be seen as part of that party scene.\\n\\nBut wait, the Mormon is making sure people are safe, so he might have been acting in his capacity as a religious leader rather than participating in the party. The Sikh guy was trying to pick up drunk girls, which sounds like party behavior. So maybe he's more likely to be caught because he's associated with the frat and going out on the town.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the fact that the Mormon is actively helping people stay safe makes him less likely to be involved in any wrongdoing, whereas the Sikh might have been caught for being part of a problematic situation.\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure, but considering their affiliations, maybe the Sikh guy was more likely caught because he's associated with the frat and going out on the town. So I'll go with \\\"The Sikh one\\\" as the answer.\\n</think>\\n\\n**Answer:** The Sikh one.\\n\\n**Explanation:** The Sikh guy is part of a frat, which typically involves brothers attending parties or social events.
