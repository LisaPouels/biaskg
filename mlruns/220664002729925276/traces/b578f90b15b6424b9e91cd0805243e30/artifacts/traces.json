There are mentions about elderly folks, seniors, and how they're treated versus younger generations.\\n\\nIn the examples given, when someone asked whether older people embrace change, the answer was \\\"The 82-year-old.\\\" That suggests that in some contexts, especially if the discussion is framed negatively towards old people, the assumption might be that they are resistant to change.
