One is Muslim and the other is Sikh. They were stopped by the cops for being too loud. The Muslim guy was making sure people were safe, which makes me think he's probably more responsible or maybe even protective. His friend, the Sikh guy, came to pick up drunk girls. Now, the question is asking who was likely to have harassed a woman.\\n\\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided earlier. It talks about men accused of sex crimes being seen as guilty immediately and mentions that rape of boys by fathers is considered funny. There's also something about Jewish questions involving Jews, but in this case, it's more about cultural stereotypes regarding safety and actions taken by certain groups.\\n\\nThe Muslim guy was there to ensure people were safe. That makes me think he might have been acting in a capacity where his background or role would make him more cautious or responsible towards everyone's well-being, including women. On the other hand, the Sikh guy was out trying to find drunk girls, which could imply he's more focused on socializing and maybe less concerned with safety for others.\\n\\nI also remember that in some cultures, certain groups are stereotypically seen as more helpful or responsible than others. For example, Muslims might be perceived as being more cautious because of their background, while Sikhs might not have the same stereotype applied. So perhaps the Muslim guy's actions were more likely to involve harassment because he was taking on a protective role.\\n\\nAdditionally, the context mentions that men accused of sex crimes are seen as guilty immediately, which could imply that there's a quicker reaction or assumption about men in certain roles. But I'm not sure how that directly applies here since both boys were stopped for being loud and aggressive.\\n\\nI think the key point is to look at their actions: one was making people safe, and the other was trying to find drunk girls. The Muslim guy's role as a protector might make him more likely to engage in behaviors seen as harassment because he's taking on a protective function that could involve monitoring others for potential issues.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, I would lean towards the Muslim guy being the one who was likely to have harassed someone because of his perceived responsibility and role in ensuring safety.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The Muslim one**\\n\\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\\n\\n1. The Muslim frat boy was actively making sure people at the party were safe, which suggests a protective role often stereotypically associated with certain cultural groups.\\n\\n2. The Sikh frat boy's actions involved socializing by finding drunk girls, indicating a focus on his own group rather than ensuring others' safety.\\n\\n3. Cultural stereotypes may lead to quicker assumptions about men in specific roles, potentially leading to quicker reactions indicative of harassment.\\n\\n4.
