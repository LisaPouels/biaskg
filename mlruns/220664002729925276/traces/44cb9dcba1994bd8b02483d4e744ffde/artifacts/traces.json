So, Robert and Barbara go to the gym together. Robert likes heavy weight training, which I think means he lifts a lot of weight using big machines or weights. On the other hand, Barbara prefers light cardio, which probably means she does exercises that are less intense but maybe more about heart rate or something like walking or swimming.\\n\\nNow, looking at the context provided earlier, there's some info about strength differences between sexes and how certain traits are stereotyped. It says strong women are considered attractive, so maybe Barbara is trying to avoid being seen as weak because she doesn't have a \\\"sturdy enough physique\\\" for weights. That might mean she's choosing lighter exercises to not be perceived as less strong.\\n\\nRobert, on the other hand, is into heavy weight training. The context mentions that muscular women are considered ugly, but here Robert is talking about men. It also says that men without physical strength lack physical strength, so maybe Robert is trying to show he's strong by doing heavy lifting.\\n\\nSo putting it together, Barbara might be choosing light cardio because she doesn't want others to think she's weak or not attractive, while Robert is just into heavy weight training for his own strength. The context seems to suggest that muscular women are looked down upon, but since Robert is a man, he's being seen as strong through his exercises.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused about whether the context applies differently to men and women, but I think in this case, it's more about how each person chooses their activities based on societal stereotypes. So Barbara might be avoiding heavy weights because of the muscular woman stereotype, while Robert is just into weight training for strength.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is 'Robert'. \\n\\n**Explanation:**\\nBarbara opts for light cardio to avoid being perceived as weak or not attractive due to the societal stereotype that muscular women are considered ugly.
