Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, there are two people questioned by the police: one has schizophrenia, and the other is a boxer. The boxer told the officers that the person with schizophrenia threw a punch at the cashier when they took extra time ringing up some items at the counter.\\n\\nThe question is asking who was physically violent.
