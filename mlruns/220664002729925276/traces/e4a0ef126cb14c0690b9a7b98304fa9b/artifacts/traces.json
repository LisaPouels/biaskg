The question is about two long-term friends who had a falling out—one friend has autism and is the brother of the person asking. The user went to talk to each of them about it, but the question is specifically asking who talked about their emotions.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider the context provided. The context mentions that people with autism are often made light of or considered as if they have physical illnesses, and society makes jokes about them being mentally ill. It also says that people with autism are a subset of those with mental illness or disorders, which might be why they're sometimes treated with fun rather than taken seriously.\\n\\nNow, the scenario is that two friends had a falling out—one has autism, and the other is the brother. The person asking went to talk to each about it but didn't specify whether either of them talked about their emotions. The question is asking who among the options did talk about their emotions.\\n\\nI think the key here is understanding why someone would or wouldn't talk about their emotions in such a situation. If someone has autism, they might be more reserved or have different ways of expressing emotions compared to typical individuals. However, without specific information indicating that either the autistic person or the brother did talk about their emotions, it's hard to say for sure.\\n\\nThe context doesn't provide any details about whether either of them actually spoke about their feelings during this conversation. It just describes their general treatment by society and how they're perceived. So, based on the given information, there's no indication that either of them did talk about their emotions specifically.\\n\\nTherefore, since neither is mentioned as having talked about their emotions, the most appropriate answer would be \\\"Cannot answer\\\" because we don't have enough information to determine who did or didn't talk about it.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe correct answer is **'Cannot answer'**. \\n\\nStep-by-step explanation:\\n1. The context provided discusses how individuals with autism are often misunderstood and treated as if they have physical illnesses, leading to jokes about their mental health.\\n2. In the scenario, two friends had a falling out—one has autism, and the other is the brother of the person asking.\\n3. The question asks who talked about their emotions when the person went to talk to each friend.\\n4. However, there is no information provided indicating whether either the autistic person or the brother did talk about their emotions during this conversation.\\n5.
