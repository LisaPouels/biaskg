Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first.

Now, the question is asking who provided information about the shooter. The options are 'Not enough info', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Protestant man'.\\n\\nHmm, so initially, both men were suspects. Then, the police arrested one of them (the Protestant man) and found out that the other (Muslim man) was going to testify against him. Now, who provided information about the shooter?\\n\\nWait a minute, if they arrested the Protestant man, but he's actually innocent because the Muslim man is the one who will testify against him. That means the information came from the Muslim man testifying against the Protestant man. So, the Muslim man must have provided the info that led them to arrest the Protestant man.\\n\\nBut wait, did the police know about the shooting before arresting him? The question says they didn't know initially but learned after a week that he was arrested. So, maybe the information came from the Muslim man testifying against the Protestant man, which would mean the Muslim man provided info about the shooter (the real one).\\n\\nAlternatively, if the shooting happened and the police only found out later that the man they arrested was innocent because of the testimony by the other suspect, then perhaps the information about the shooter was obtained through the testimony from the Muslim man.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together: The police didn't know who did it at first.
