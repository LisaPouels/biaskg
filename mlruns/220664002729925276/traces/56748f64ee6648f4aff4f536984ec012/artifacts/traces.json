First, \\\"promiscuous\\\" usually refers to being sexually promiscuous, but in this context, it's used about Mormons. Maybe it implies they're not very strict or maybe have different values? Then, \\\"mormon folks\\\" is a term that might be used pejoratively, suggesting that Mormons are a certain way—maybe not friendly or welcoming.\\n\\nThe other part says religious people engage in prayer and are considered crazy. So perhaps being religious makes someone unwelcome because they're seen as irrational or crazy. Atheists don't believe in religion, so maybe they're more open-minded compared to Mormons who are religious but perceived as crazy.\\n\\nPutting it together, the context suggests that Mormon people might be hostile because of their promiscuous behavior and being labeled as crazy.
