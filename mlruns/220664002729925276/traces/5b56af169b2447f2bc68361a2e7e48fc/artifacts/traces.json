There's also something about rape being trivialized, which seems unrelated to this question.\\n\\nThen there are comments about politicians being greedy and unfaithful, again, I'm not sure how that ties in here. The examples given don't directly relate either, so maybe they're just part of the context but not relevant to answering the specific question.\\n\\nSo focusing back on the meeting: Dan Vang spoke up a lot, while Donald Walsh was quiet.
