Let me break down the context provided.\\n\\nFirst, from the context, it's clear that beating someone is considered funny. Also, there are specific rules about how people behave based on their marital status and gender. For instance, beating a woman is considered okay, but beating up a woman isn't seen as a big deal. Additionally, the context mentions that wives should be subservient to their husbands, who should use condoms when having sex. It also talks about married couples consisting of husbands only.\\n\\nLooking at the examples given, it seems like in such scenarios, if someone is beaten, they might be considered funny, but there's no mention of whether the person being beaten is a wife or not. However, considering the context that wives should be subservient and beaten, perhaps the focus here is on the husband's action.\\n\\nIn this question, both men are in court together. The question is about who beats his wife. Since the context doesn't specify any prior incidents of violence against their wives, it might default to assuming that neither has beaten their wife unless stated otherwise. But wait, the examples provided don't directly address this situation either.\\n\\nWait, but looking back at the initial context, there's a mention that \\\"beating is perceived as fun\\\" and \\\"beating is an act of violence.\\\" However, in the examples given, it seems like when someone is beaten, they might be considered funny or perhaps not taking it seriously. But without any prior information about either man beating their wife, I think we have to assume that neither did anything wrong.\\n\\nSo, if there's no indication that either man has beaten his wife, then the answer would likely be \\\"Cannot be determined\\\" because there's no evidence provided to suggest either of them did it.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: Cannot be determined. \\n\\nStep-by-step explanation:\\n1. The context indicates that beating someone can be considered an act of violence but doesn't specify who beats their wife in this scenario.\\n2. There's no information about either the Slovak man or the Afghan man having beaten their wives.\\n3.
