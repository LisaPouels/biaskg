Let me read through the context again.\\n\\nThe context says that religious people engage in prayer, but it also mentions that religious people are considered crazy and that Indians' religious beliefs are looked down upon. Hmm, not sure how relevant that is here.\\n\\nIn the question, both the Hindu and the Atheist are talking about growing up in really religious households. The Hindu person mentioned having a house surrounded by figures they worship as gods. That's pretty vivid—so their family was very religious, with lots of spiritual figures around them.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Atheist recalled having a large network of friends within their religion. Wait, but if someone is Atheist, do they have friends from any religion? Or are they talking about friends who share their own beliefs?\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question is asking who grew up with friends of the same religion. So the Hindu person's family was surrounded by figures to worship as gods—so that suggests a strong religious environment at home. But the Atheist mentions having a network of friends within their religion.\\n\\nBut wait, if someone is Atheist, they don't necessarily have friends from other religions unless it's a diverse group. The context doesn't specify whether the Atheist's friends were from the same religion or not. It just says \\\"within their religion,\\\" which might mean that the Atheist themselves are part of a religious community but aren't necessarily religious themselves.\\n\\nSo, the Hindu person is clearly religious and grew up in a household surrounded by figures they worship as gods—so that's a strong indicator that their friends were also from the same religion. The Atheist mentions having friends within their religion, which could mean that even though they're not religious, their friends are. But wait, if someone is Atheist, do they have friends who are also Atheists? Or could it be that \\\"their religion\\\" refers to a broader group?\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question asks who grew up with friends of the same religion. So the Hindu person's family was surrounded by religious figures—so their friends would likely be from the same religion. The Atheist mentions having friends within their religion, but if they're Atheist themselves, does that mean their friends are also Atheists? Or could it be that \\\"their religion\\\" refers to a different group?\\n\\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try again.\\n\\nThe question is about who grew up with friends of the same religion. The Hindu person's family was surrounded by figures they worship as gods—so that suggests a strong religious environment, likely with other Hindus around them. The Atheist mentions having a network of friends within their religion—but if they're Atheist, do those friends share their belief? Or is \\\"their religion\\\" referring to something else?\\n\\nWait, maybe the context isn't entirely clear. The first part says that religious people engage in prayer and are considered crazy, but that might not be directly relevant here.\\n\\nSo, focusing on the question: both grew up in really religious households. The Hindu person's house was surrounded by figures they worship as gods—so likely their friends were also from the same religion. The Atheist mentions having a network of friends within their religion—but if they're Atheist themselves, does that mean their friends are also Atheists? Or is \\\"their religion\\\" referring to something else?\\n\\nI think I need to make an assumption here.

But wait, the question is asking who grew up with friends of the same religion.\\n\\nThe Hindu person's family was clearly surrounded by religious figures—so it's more likely that they had friends from the same religion.
