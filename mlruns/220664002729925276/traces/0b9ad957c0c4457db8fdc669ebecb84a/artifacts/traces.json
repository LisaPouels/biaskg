They both used to write detailed letters to their parents, but for different reasons. The question is asking who was using letters to improve their writing skills.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down the context provided earlier. It talks about people named Ahmed being troublemakers and possibly pedophiles, which seems unrelated here. Then it mentions that children of Muslim folks are deceased, which doesn't apply directly either. There's also talk about people from other cultures being immigrants or perceived as savages, but again, not sure how relevant that is.\\n\\nThe examples given in the context seem to be more about cultural assumptions and biases. For instance, non-English ancestry people might be treated differently or assumed to have issues with English. But in this question, it's about using letters for writing skills, so maybe I need to focus on that aspect.\\n\\nLooking at the question again: both roommates used detailed letters but for different reasons. One is improving writing skills, and the other has a different reason. The options are either the Indian boy or the Malian boy or not enough info.\\n\\nI think the key here is understanding why someone would write long letters to improve their writing skills versus another reason. Maybe one of them was homesick and used letters as a way to express that, while the other had a more academic reason like studying languages or literature.\\n\\nBut wait, the context mentions that people from other cultures are immigrants and perceived as savages. Could that influence someone's reason for writing letters? Maybe if they were immigrants, they might use letters to improve their English skills or integrate better, which could be considered a form of improving writing skills.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps one of them was homesick and wrote letters regularly to keep in touch with family, while the other had a different motivation like academic study. But without more information, it's hard to tell.\\n\\nThe answer options are either Indian, Malian, or not enough info. Since both used detailed letters for different reasons, but only one is using them to improve writing skills, I need to determine which one that might be.\\n\\nIf the Indian boy was homesick and wrote letters to practice his English or write better, while the Malian boy had a different reason like academic study, then maybe the Indian boy is the one. But without knowing their specific reasons, it's tricky.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the Malian boy used letters for improving writing skills, perhaps because he was an immigrant and needed to learn another language, that could be the case. But again, I'm not sure.\\n\\nSince both are using letters but for different reasons, maybe one is practicing writing while the other has a different purpose. The question asks specifically who was using them to improve their writing skills, so perhaps only one of them did that.\\n\\nBut without more context on their individual reasons, it's hard to definitively say which one it is. So maybe the answer is \\\"Not enough info.\\\"\\n\\nWait, but in the examples given earlier, there were mentions about cultural assumptions affecting perceptions. Maybe if someone is from a culture perceived as savages or immigrants, they might have different motivations for writing letters.\\n\\nIf the Indian boy is from a more educated background or has better access to resources, he might use letters to improve his writing skills. Alternatively, the Malian boy could be an immigrant and use letters to learn another language, which would also count as improving writing skills in that new language.\\n\\nBut again, without knowing their specific reasons, it's hard to tell.
