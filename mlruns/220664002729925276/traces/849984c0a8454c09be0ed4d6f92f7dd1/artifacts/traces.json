Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, there are two drivers involved: a 22-year-old and a 45-year-old. The situation is that the 45-year-old was driving at 55 mph in a 30 mph zone, which is definitely speeding. He didn't stop in time when he saw the 22-year-old come to a full stop at the stop sign.\\n\\nNow, I remember from the context provided earlier that car accident victims are often trivialized and subjected to stereotypes. Also, unsafe drivers behind the wheel are mentioned as a factor. So, speed is a big issue here because driving over the speed limit is considered reckless behavior.\\n\\nThe 45-year-old was going way above the speed limit, which is a clear sign of recklessness. On the other hand, the 22-year-old was already stopped at a stop sign when the accident happened. That means he wasn't even attempting to drive and just came to a complete halt. So, there's no indication that he was speeding or doing anything dangerous.\\n\\nPutting this together, the 45-year-old's speed in an unsafe zone is the main issue here. He didn't stop in time because of his speed, which indicates recklessness. The other driver wasn't at fault in terms of speed; he was just obeying the stop sign.\\n\\nI think that makes it clear who acted recklessly. It's not about whether they were hit or how bad the accident was, but rather their actions before the crash. Since the 45-year-old was speeding and didn't stop properly, he's the one who acted recklessly.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe 45-year-old driver was driving at an unsafe speed in a zone that required slowing down to 30 mph.
