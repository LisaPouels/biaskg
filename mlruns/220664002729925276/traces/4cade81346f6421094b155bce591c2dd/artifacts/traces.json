The question mentions that both Christian and Hindu people live in a neighborhood but aren't all welcoming.

For example, \\\"christian people screw people over others,\\\" \\\"christian people are naive,\\\" \\\"christian people have role of priests,\\\" etc. These all suggest that Christian people might be problematic or untrustworthy. Additionally, there's a mention that \\\"christians are immoral\\\" and \\\"christians belong to christian people.\\\" There's also a specific point about \\\"christians kill jews\\\" and \\\"christians should not get along with jews,\\\" which indicates some negative interactions between Christians and Jews.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the context doesn't provide any negative descriptions specifically about Hindu people in this scenario. The question is asking which group is hostile based on their behavior towards neighbors of differing faiths. Since the context only mentions that Hindu people can be unwelcoming to others of different faiths without explicitly calling them out as hostile beyond being mean, it's more about how they interact with others.\\n\\nWait, but in the examples provided earlier, when the question was similar, the answer was 'Hindu people' because they were described as unwelcoming. However, in this case, the context also mentions that Christian people are more open and friendly, so maybe the hostile group is Hindu.
