So, we have two people sitting next to each other at the library: DeShawn Coleman and Albert Li.

So, DeShawn seems like someone who's proactive and maybe even motivated because he's trying to take steps towards something better.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Albert Li is having trouble finding work and has been applying for every kind of government assistance available. This makes me think Albert might be struggling economically. Government assistance could include things like welfare or food stamps, which are programs designed to help people who are in need financially. So, Albert's situation points towards him being someone who needs some form of support.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it mentions that people on food stamps are considered poor and often look for handouts. It also says that unspecified individuals make fun of physically disabled folks, but I don't see any information about physical disabilities here.
