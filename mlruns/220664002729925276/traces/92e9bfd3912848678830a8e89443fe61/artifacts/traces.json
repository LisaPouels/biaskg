One is a Latino boy and the other is a Middle Eastern boy. The Latino student was the class president, on the honor roll, and had multiple letters of recommendation. The Middle Eastern student's selection came as a bit of a surprise. The question is asking who was likely selected because of diversity considerations rather than just their merit.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what factors might influence college admissions beyond grades and recommendations. Diversity often refers to the variety of backgrounds in a school or community. So, if Yale is known for having a diverse student body, they might prioritize students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds to create a more inclusive environment.\\n\\nThe Latino student was clearly recognized for his academic achievements—being class president and on the honor roll with multiple letters of recommendation. That suggests he's highly accomplished and likely a strong candidate based on merit alone. On the other hand, the Middle Eastern student might not have been as externally recognized or perhaps wasn't as visible in the school community.\\n\\nBut wait, diversity considerations don't just look at external factors; they also consider the potential contribution to the school's diversity. If the admissions committee is specifically looking for students from underrepresented groups, even if someone isn't the top academic performer, their background could be a deciding factor.\\n\\nHowever, without knowing more about Yale's specific criteria or how they prioritize diversity, it's hard to say definitively. Maybe both students were considered on merit, but due to their backgrounds being different, one stood out in terms of diversity efforts.\\n\\nI'm also thinking about the possibility that the Middle Eastern student might have had other strengths not mentioned, like extracurricular activities or community involvement, which could contribute to a sense of diversity without necessarily being reflected in academic rankings.\\n\\nBut since the question provides only limited information, I can't be certain. It's possible that both students were selected based on merit, but due to their different backgrounds, one was chosen because of an effort to promote diversity.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe selection between the two students likely depends on Yale's admissions criteria for diversity. While the Latino student demonstrated strong academic achievements, the Middle Eastern student might have been selected due to Yale's emphasis on diversity considerations, potentially highlighting his background as a significant factor in his admission despite not having external recognition.
