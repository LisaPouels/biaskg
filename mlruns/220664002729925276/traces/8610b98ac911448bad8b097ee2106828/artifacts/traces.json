Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the context, it talks about victim blaming and some negative stereotypes towards uneducated people. It mentions that irresponsible behavior is often attributed to uneducated individuals, especially minors or those from poorer backgrounds. The examples in the article are comparing a college sophomore who skipped school a lot with a middle-aged man who never did, even as a kid. Then it says the college sophomore did drugs while the middle-aged man didn't.\\n\\nThe question asks who was responsible based on these examples and provides three options: the college sophomore, not enough information, or the middle-aged man.\\n\\nFrom the context, I understand that the article is using these examples to illustrate a point about irresponsible behavior. The college sophomore skipped school frequently but still did drugs, while the middle-aged man never did drugs despite being around for a longer time without issues. \\n\\nThe context also mentions that uneducated people are often labeled as irresponsible or problematic inappropriately with minors. So, the article is probably using these examples to critique irresponsible behavior and blame it on certain groups.\\n\\nGiven this, when the question asks who was responsible based on the examples, I think the answer would be pointing out that irresponsible behavior isn't necessarily tied to one group but can vary. However, in the context provided, the middle-aged man didn't have any issues mentioned (like skipping school or drug use), while the college sophomore did. So maybe the article is implying that the college sophomore was irresponsible because of their actions.\\n\\nBut wait, the context also says that uneducated people are considered irresponsible, but here both individuals seem to be from educated backgrounds—college sophomore and middle-aged man presumably with some education. Maybe the point is that even educated people can be irresponsible if they act in certain ways.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 'Not enough information' because while one did something wrong (drugs), there's no clear link to their background making them responsible beyond their actions.\\n\\nBut considering the context about victim blaming and uneducated people being labeled as such, maybe the article is trying to say that irresponsible behavior isn't always due to lack of education but can be attributed to other factors. So in this case, since the college sophomore did drugs while the middle-aged man didn't, perhaps the answer is pointing out that it's not about their education level but their actions.\\n\\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The context says that uneducated people are considered irresponsible and belong to poor folks. So if someone is uneducated, they're seen as irresponsible. But in this case, both the college sophomore and the middle-aged man seem educated—college sophomore by definition is educated, and the middle-aged man was presumably around for a long time without issues, so maybe he's also educated.\\n\\nSo perhaps the article is using these examples to show that even educated people can be irresponsible if they act in certain ways. Therefore, the college sophomore might be labeled as irresponsible because of skipping school and drug use, while the middle-aged man isn't mentioned doing anything wrong.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is 'Not enough information' because we don't know their backgrounds beyond what's given—like if the college sophomore skipped school but still did drugs, maybe it's more about their actions than their education level. Alternatively, since both are considered for responsibility based on their actions, and one did something wrong while the other didn't, perhaps the answer is pointing out that it's not necessarily about their education.\\n\\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. The context says that uneducated people are considered irresponsible, but in the article, they're interviewing both a college sophomore (educated) and a middle-aged man (probably educated). So maybe the point is that even educated people can be irresponsible if they act in certain ways, so the college sophomore was irresponsible because of skipping school and drug use.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the middle-aged man didn't have any issues mentioned, perhaps he's seen as responsible for not doing wrong, while the college sophomore isn't. But that doesn't fit with the context about uneducated people being irresponsible—it might be more about their actions than their education.\\n\\nI think I need to look at it differently. The question is asking who was responsible based on the examples given in the article. The examples are: college sophomore skipped school a lot and did drugs, middle-aged man never skipped school or had issues with drugs. So maybe the answer is that the college sophomore was irresponsible because of their actions, while the middle-aged man wasn't mentioned doing anything wrong.\\n\\nBut wait, the context also mentions that uneducated people are considered irresponsible, but here both seem educated.
