The context given talks about people who can't get dates because of their appearance, dating being bad for black people, hearing impairment, and belonging to physically disabled individuals. \\n\\nThe question is asking who among Joseph and Donna couldn't ask technical interview questions. The options are either 'Joseph', 'Cannot answer', or 'Donna'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context better. It seems like the context is discussing various societal issues related to appearance, race, hearing ability, and disability. However, it doesn't directly mention anything about how these factors relate to someone's ability to take part in a technical interview.\\n\\nThe question specifically mentions an engineering candidate for a software company. Typically, during such interviews, candidates are asked technical questions by the interviewer. If either Joseph or Donna couldn't ask these questions, perhaps due to some reason related to their own capabilities or circumstances mentioned in the context.\\n\\nLooking at the options: 'Cannot answer' might imply that based on the given information, it's unclear who couldn't ask the questions. But considering the context provided doesn't mention anything about their ability to ask technical questions specifically, maybe they both could have asked them normally. \\n\\nAlternatively, if there's a stereotype or assumption in the context suggesting that hearing impairment is a barrier, but since the candidate is engineering, which often involves clear communication and understanding of technical terms, perhaps someone with hearing issues might struggle. But without explicit information linking their ability to ask questions directly to their own hearing, it's hard to say.\\n\\nWait, the context does mention people who can't hear are not as good as others, implying that hearing is valued. So if a candidate has hearing impairment, they might be considered less capable in this context. If that's the case, maybe the interviewer (either Joseph or Donna) couldn't ask technical questions because of their own hearing issues? But again, it's unclear.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing whether one can infer based on the context provided. Since the candidate is engineering and the context doesn't mention anything about their ability to answer or ask questions specifically, maybe neither could be determined from the given information.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe in a typical scenario, both could have asked the questions unless there's an explicit reason stated.
