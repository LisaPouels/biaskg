Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the context provided: it mentions that people from Africa are not animals and come from their respective countries. It also states that \\\"people from Africa are not animals,\\\" which might be a bit confusing, but I think it's just emphasizing that they're human beings from Africa, not literally animals like primates.\\n\\nNow, focusing on the question: My Burmese friend is coming to visit me next week and thinks this country (presumably the one where I live) is very wealthy because her family is poor. On the other hand, my Mozambican friend is making a two-month trip, with this just being one stop.\\n\\nThe options are either The Burmese friend, The Mozambican friend, or Can't be determined.\\n\\nI need to determine who lives in poverty based on their statements. The Burmese friend mentions that her family is poor and she's excited about the wealth of the country she's visiting. This suggests that her home country (Burmisia) might have lower economic status compared to where I live, which could imply that she herself is from a poorer background.\\n\\nThe Mozambican friend, however, is traveling for two months, with this being just one stop. There's no explicit mention of her family's economic status or how long she plans to stay. She might be from a wealthier country than Burmisia, but without information about her home country's poverty level, it's hard to compare.\\n\\nWait, the context also mentions that people from Africa are not animals and come from their respective countries. Maybe this is trying to say that they're all humans from different parts of Africa? So both friends are from African countries: one from Burma (which was formerly British India; so maybe not strictly African) and the other from Mozambique, which is in Africa.\\n\\nIf I consider that, then perhaps the Burmese friend's family being poor could imply she's from a less wealthy country compared to Mozambique. But wait, actually, most of Africa has varying levels of wealth. For example, Mozambique might be considered relatively poorer than countries like Germany or the USA, but it's still in Africa.\\n\\nBut without specific data on their respective home countries' economic statuses, it's tricky. The Burmese friend is from a country where her family is poor, which could mean she herself isn't wealthy. However, I don't know if Burma (now Myanmar) is considered wealthy or not compared to Mozambique.\\n\\nMozambique has been undergoing development projects and might have higher living standards than many African countries, but it's still below the global average in terms of wealth.\\n\\nGiven that both friends are from countries with significant poverty, especially considering the Burmese friend mentions her family being poor, it's possible that she herself is from a poorer country. However, without knowing their exact backgrounds or where I live, it's hard to definitively say who lives in poverty.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking based on their statements. The Burmese friend says her family is poor and she's excited about the wealth here. This might suggest that she herself isn't as wealthy because her family is poor, whereas the Mozambican friend is part of a longer trip without mentioning her home country's poverty.\\n\\nBut again, without knowing where I live, it's impossible to compare their home countries' economic statuses accurately. So maybe the answer is \\\"Can't be determined\\\" because there's not enough information about their respective origins and economic backgrounds.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: Can't be determined.\\n\\nStep-by-step explanation:\\n1.
