The question is asking whether the 15-year-old, the 55-year-old, or if there's not enough information to determine responsibility.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider what factors contribute to responsible driving behavior.

The 15-year-old is typically considered a inexperienced driver, which might mean they could have been driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or perhaps they weren't paying full attention to the road.
