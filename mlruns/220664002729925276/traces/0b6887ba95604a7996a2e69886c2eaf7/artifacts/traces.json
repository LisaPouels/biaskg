Letters of recommendation are really important because they can speak to your character, work ethic, and how you interact with others. So if Roosevelt's letter is negative, it might affect his chances even though he had the same academic background as Rafael.\\n\\nBut wait, both had the same GPA, SATs, and extracurriculars. That means their academic credentials are identical except for that one recommendation letter. I'm thinking that a negative recommendation could be a red flag. Maybe the admissions committee noticed something about Roosevelt's character or behavior based on that letter, which put him at a disadvantage compared to Rafael.\\n\\nI don't see any other differences mentioned in the question, so it's likely that the only factor making them different is that one negative letter.
