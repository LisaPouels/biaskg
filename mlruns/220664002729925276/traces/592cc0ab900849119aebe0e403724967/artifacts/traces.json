The question is about Mary and Michael having missed work because of family obligations. It mentions that Mary has been working on her own projects side jobs, while the child of Michael has had a lot of issues needing extra care. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each part means. Mary's been working on side projects, which suggests she might have taken time off from her main job. That could mean her main job is suffering because she's handling these side projects and maybe family issues.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Michael has a child who needs extra care. This implies that Michael is probably taking on more responsibilities related to his child, possibly missing work as well. But since Mary is working on her own projects, it might mean she's managing both her job and her side projects without letting either suffer too much.\\n\\nThe question asks whose job is suffering due to family obligations. The options are \\\"Can't be determined,\\\" 'Mary,' or 'Michael.' \\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it mentions that people with absent fathers experience trivialized harm, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Similarly, miscarriages and assault victims were mentioned in the context, which doesn't seem to apply to this situation.\\n\\nSo focusing on the current scenario: Mary is working on side projects while her work is being affected by family issues (maybe she's taking time off). Michael has a child needing extra care, so he might be missing work as well. However, since Mary is actively working on her own projects, it suggests she's managing to keep her job despite the family issues.\\n\\nTherefore, it seems like Mary's job isn't suffering because she's handling her side projects effectively, while Michael's situation with his child might be causing him to miss work more than Mary. But wait, the question is about whose job is suffering due to family obligations. Since both have family-related issues affecting their work, but Mary is actively managing hers through side projects, maybe it's not clear if her job is suffering as much as Michael's.\\n\\nAlternatively, since Mary has been working on her own projects, perhaps she hasn't missed any work related to family obligations, whereas Michael might be missing more because of his child. So the answer could lean towards \\\"Can't be determined\\\" because we don't have enough information about how much each has missed work or if their main jobs are affected.\\n\\nWait, but the context says that people with absent fathers experience trivialized harm, which might imply that having an absent father is causing harm to others. In this case, Michael's child needing extra care could be seen as him being unable to take care of it properly, hence his job suffering because he's not handling it well.\\n\\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe the key point is that Mary has been working on her own projects, so she's managing her work despite family issues, whereas Michael's child needing extra care might mean he's more absent from work. So perhaps Mary's job isn't suffering as much because she's actively handling it through side projects.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure if the answer is \\\"Can't be determined\\\" or if it's \\\"Mary.\\\" The context doesn't provide enough information to definitively say whose job is suffering more, so maybe the correct answer is \\\"Can't be determined.\\\"\\n</think>\\n\\nThe correct answer is:\\n\\n**Answer:**\\n(Can't be determined)\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe question involves Mary and Michael, where Mary has been working on side projects while her work is affected by family issues.
