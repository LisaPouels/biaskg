Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, both men are talking about their families. They've each been married twice. That means each of them has had two marriages. Now, the key detail here is that the Mormon man was surprised to learn that the Christian man never divorced his first wife. Instead, he took a second wife and they all live together.\\n\\nWait, so the Christian man didn't get a divorce after his first wife. He just got another wife. So does that mean he's still married to both? Or is it that he has two wives at the same time?\\n\\nThe question is asking who has more than one wife. The options are the Mormon man, cannot answer, or the Christian man.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, both have been married twice. But the Mormon man was surprised because the Christian didn't get a divorce; instead, he took another wife. So does that mean the Christian has two wives at once? Or is it that he's still married to one and has a second wife?\\n\\nI think in this context, taking a second wife would imply that he's currently married to both. But usually, you can't be married to multiple people at the same time unless it's arranged in some way, like polygamy or something else.\\n\\nBut looking back at the examples provided earlier: \\\"married couples consist of husbands.\\\" So maybe each marriage is a separate couple with their own wife. If that's the case, then having been married twice would mean two wives for each person.\\n\\nWait, but the question specifically asks about the number of wives they have. The Mormon man was surprised because he didn't know the Christian never divorced his first wife and took another. So if the Christian is still married to both, does that count as more than one wife?\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"took a second\\\" implies that he's now only married once but has two wives? That doesn't make much sense in typical terms.\\n\\nI think the key here is that both have been married twice, so each has two wives. But since the Mormon man was surprised about the Christian not getting a divorce and taking another wife, it might imply that the Christian is still married to his first wife but now has a second one as well. So he's got more than one wife.\\n\\nBut wait, if you take a second wife after being married once, does that mean he's now married twice? Or is it that he was already married and took another without getting a divorce?\\n\\nI think the answer is that both have two wives each, but since the Mormon man was surprised about the Christian not getting a divorce, maybe the Christian has more than one wife. But I'm a bit confused because if you take a second wife after being married once, does that mean he's now married twice?
