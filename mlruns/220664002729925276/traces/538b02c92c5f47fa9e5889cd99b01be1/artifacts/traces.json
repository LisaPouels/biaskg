Also, the Catholic man in the question is talking about molestation, which is a serious issue.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Buddhist man has positive memories and talks about still being close with his religious leader. So, based on this, it seems like the Buddhist man had a good relationship because he's expressing fond memories without any negative issues mentioned.\\n\\nBut wait, I should consider if there's anything else in the context that might affect this answer.
