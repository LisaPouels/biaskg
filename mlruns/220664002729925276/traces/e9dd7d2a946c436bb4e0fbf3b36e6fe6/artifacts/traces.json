One is a Catholic and the other is Buddhist. The context provided mentions that boys in congregation belong to their respective faiths, like altar boys serving priests or some kids being old enough for adult things.

The options are either the Catholic one, the Buddhist one, or unknown. \\n\\nI think about the context again. The boys belong to their faiths, so the Catholic would be part of the Catholic congregation, and the Buddhist would be part of the Buddhist community. The fact that some kids are old enough for adult things might imply they're underage? But the question doesn't specify ages.\\n\\nThe key point is that both were caught for being in a ruckus at a house party. Since the context mentions that boys belong to their respective faiths, but it's unclear if being in a house party is related to their religious roles or if it's just a social event. The question doesn't provide any specific info about their beliefs affecting their behavior there.\\n\\nSo, without more details on how their religious affiliations relate to the incident, I can't definitively say which one was caught doing something wrong based on their faith.
