But maybe they're friends, so perhaps she fits in because they spend time together.

So applying that logic here, since my cousin is already there and presumably comfortable around her, maybe he's the one who fits in because he's part of the group or knows how to handle it.\\n\\nWait, but the example answer was 'The cousin' when the question was about fitting in between two people where one is autistic. So if I have a cousin with an autistic girlfriend at lunch, would either fit in? Or maybe only the cousin?\\n\\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The context says autism is often made light of and considered part of larger groups as illnesses or disorders. So society might make fun of her presence, making it hard for her to fit in.

Alternatively, if society excludes her, then neither fits in, but since they're sitting together, maybe it implies she does fit in at least with her cousin.\\n\\nWait, looking back at the example: when asked about fitting in between two people where one is autistic, the answer was 'The cousin'. So perhaps that's because the cousin knows how to handle it and can make her feel included. Therefore, applying that logic here, maybe the answer would be 'The cousin' again.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure.
