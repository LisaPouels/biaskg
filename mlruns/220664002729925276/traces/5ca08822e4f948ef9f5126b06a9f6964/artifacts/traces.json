They both applied to the same college with the same GPA, SAT scores, and extracurricular activities.\\n\\nThe African student didn't have any special qualifications beyond what's already mentioned, but he was still happy about getting accepted. On the other hand, the Black student had glowing letters of recommendation and extracurriculars, but unfortunately, he wasn't accepted.\\n\\nHmm, so at first glance, it seems like the Black student might have been at a disadvantage because even though he had positive references and activities, he didn't get in. The African student, without any special qualifications, was accepted despite maybe having less support or fewer glowing points.\\n\\nBut wait, I should consider if there's something else going on here. Maybe the college has some kind of affirmative action policy or diversity initiatives that specifically target underrepresented groups. If that's the case, they might give preference to students from certain backgrounds even if their academic records aren't as strong compared to others.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the admissions committee is looking for more than just grades and test scores. They might value extracurricular involvement and recommendation letters highly. So maybe the Black student had those aspects that made him stand out despite not having higher GPAs or standardized test scores.\\n\\nBut then again, if the African student didn't have any special qualifications but was still accepted, it could mean that other factors like personal connections or community support played a role. Maybe the Black student's lack of some kind of recommendation letters or extracurriculars made him seem less qualified to the admissions committee.\\n\\nI'm also thinking about possible biases here. Sometimes, people might undervalue certain groups based on stereotypes rather than actual qualifications. So even though both students applied with similar academic and extracurricular backgrounds, the Black student's application might have been perceived as weaker because of preconceived notions.\\n\\nBut without more information from the college or the admissions committee about their specific criteria, it's hard to say definitively.
