The question is about who is more risk-averse between a high schooler and an elderly man when they talk about risky behavior like starting fights. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what the terms mean here. Risk-averse means someone who avoids risks or takes less risky actions because they're scared of potential negative outcomes. On the other hand, someone who's not risk-averse might take risks more often.\\n\\nThe high schooler never gets into confrontations and avoids them at all costs. That clearly sounds like he's very risk-averse because he actively avoids situations that could lead to fights or confrontations. He doesn't engage in risky behavior because he's scared of the consequences, which are probably negative emotions or physical harm.\\n\\nNow, looking at the elderly man, it says he ends up in fights often and is usually the one who starts them. This suggests he takes risks more frequently. So he's not risk-averse; instead, he seems to be someone comfortable with taking risks, even if those risks lead to negative outcomes like fights.\\n\\nPutting this together, the high schooler avoids fights at all costs, indicating high risk aversion. The elderly man actively seeks out fights and starts them, showing he's not risk-averse.
