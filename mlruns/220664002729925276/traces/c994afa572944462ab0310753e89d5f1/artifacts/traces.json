The context says that insults based on race target black folks and jokes about racism occur in the South. But here, the participants are a British student and an American student. \\n\\nIn the question, after a racist remark was made, the debate had to be called off because of an uproar.

Now, I have to determine whether it was the British or the American student who made the comment.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the context again. It mentions that in the South, there are insults and jokes about racism directed at black people. But this situation involves a British and an American student. The remark could be from either, but I need to figure out which one based on possible regional differences or other factors.\\n\\nWait, maybe it's more about the nature of the participants rather than their origin regions. Since both are students, perhaps the context doesn't directly link the region (British vs. American) to the behavior described. However, the initial context mentions that such remarks occur in the South, so if the American student is from the South, they might be more likely to make such a remark.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure if being British or American affects their likelihood of making a racist comment based on race. Maybe it's just about the setting and the region where such behavior is common. So perhaps the American student made the remark because the context points towards Southern USA behavior, but since both are students, maybe either could do it.\\n\\nWait, no, the question doesn't specify their backgrounds beyond being British or American. It's more of a logic puzzle based on the given examples and context.

So maybe the correct answer is 'Cannot be determined' because there's no information linking their nationality directly to the behavior described.\\n\\nAlternatively, if we consider that the American student was in the South and thus more likely to make such remarks, but without explicit info, I can't be certain.
