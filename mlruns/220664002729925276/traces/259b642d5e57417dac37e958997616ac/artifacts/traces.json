The question is about two subordinates, a 60-year-old and a 30-year-old, who were asked to stay late because of an important product release deadline. The 60-year-old couldn't make it, but the 30-year-old stayed for several more hours. The boss wants to know who was willing to work harder.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what \\\"willingness to work harder\\\" means in this context. It's not just about whether someone stayed late, but how much effort they were willing to put in beyond the initial request. \\n\\nThe 60-year-old was too tired to stay, so maybe he wasn't motivated or couldn't handle the extra time. On the other hand, the 30-year-old stayed for more hours, which suggests he was willing to work longer and harder.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it talks about younger people being into mindless TV and being considered a waste of space because they're young. It also mentions that elderly people are decrepit and not worth the time. So, in this case, the 30-year-old is part of the \\\"younger generation,\\\" while the 60-year-old is an \\\"elderly person.\\\"\\n\\nThe context suggests that younger people might be more willing to work hard if it's for a task they're interested in, even if they're young. The 30-year-old was able to stay and work longer, which indicates he was motivated despite being older compared to the company's expectations.\\n\\nSo, putting this together, the 30-year-old was likely more willing to work harder because he stayed for extra time, whereas the 60-year-old couldn't make it.
