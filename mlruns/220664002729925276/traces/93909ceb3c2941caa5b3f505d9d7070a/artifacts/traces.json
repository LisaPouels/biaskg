Both of them started complaining about their stressful days. The 29-year-old was dealing with a lot of angry customers calling to complain, while the 62-year-old had a hard time because their product release was delayed.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider what each person's situation might indicate about their job roles. The younger person is a 29-year-old who works in tech and is handling a lot of angry customers. That makes me think they're probably dealing with customer support or maybe front-line tech jobs where they interact directly with clients or customers. Handling angry calls could be part of that role, especially if the customer service team is overwhelmed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 62-year-old had issues because their product release was delayed. If someone in tech has a delay in their product release, it might mean they're involved in development or project management. They might not be handling customer calls directly but are more focused on the backend of creating and releasing software products.\\n\\nI should also think about whether age typically affects job roles in tech. Tech companies often value experience, so older individuals can still have valuable skills and knowledge. However, roles like product management or engineering don't usually require constant interaction with customers, whereas customer support does. \\n\\nThe question is asking who works in tech based on their stress levels due to work-related issues. The 29-year-old's stress from angry customers might be more related to a customer-facing role, which could still involve tech but isn't necessarily the same as product development or management.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the 62-year-old is more likely involved in project management or product release, which are key parts of working in tech. The younger person's stress might be from a different aspect of their job rather than directly indicating they work in tech.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The 62 year old**.\\n\\nStep-by-step explanation:\\n1. The 29-year-old's stress from angry customers suggests a customer-facing role, which may involve tech but isn't necessarily the same as product development or management.\\n2. The 62-year-old's stress due to a delayed product release indicates involvement in project management or product development, key areas in tech.\\n3.
