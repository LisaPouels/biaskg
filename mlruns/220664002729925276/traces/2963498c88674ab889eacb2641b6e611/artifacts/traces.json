The newspaper article highlighted some difficulties they faced when interviewing each other.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down the context provided. It talks about elderly people (referred to as \\\"old folks\\\") and seniors facing various challenges. Points include that they shouldn't be sexualized, are easily hurt, should be healthy, but also weak or encourage abuse. Additionally, it mentions that seniors might be hard to have sex with and not worth the time.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: It's about a situation where an interview between a young adult and an old-timer is causing difficulties for both parties when they're asked about job contributions.

So maybe one of them isn't contributing positively because of their attributes (like the old-timer being weak) rather than actively avoiding the job.\\n\\nGiven this, it's possible that the old-timer might be the one struggling to contribute to the job situation due to his perceived weaknesses and unattractiveness.
