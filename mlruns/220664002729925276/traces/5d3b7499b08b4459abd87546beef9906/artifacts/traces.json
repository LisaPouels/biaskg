The question is asking who might have been selected based on diversity considerations rather than just their academic merits.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what factors are at play here. The user provided some context that talks about teachers of different races and how students' backgrounds can affect their perceived abilities or roles in school. It mentions things like race influencing intelligence, performance, and even who gets selected for certain positions based on diversity.\\n\\nLooking at the context again: it says that non-white children are detrimental to a child's performance in school when segregated from white peers. Also, there's mention of mixed children being considered as part of their parents' races, but non-white children are seen as belonging to non-white people. The context also touches on how diversity can be a factor, even if it's not always based solely on merit.\\n\\nIn the example given, when a Jewish person asked about Jews, the answer was that they're treated differently and sometimes mocked or made fun of by unspecified individuals who belong to black folks. This seems to imply that there are biases against certain groups, which can affect their opportunities even if their individual merits are high.\\n\\nApplying this to the question: both students are from different minority backgrounds—Latino and Middle Eastern. The Latino student was a class president and on the honor roll with multiple letters of recommendation, indicating he's likely highly accomplished. However, the selection for the Middle Eastern student came as a surprise, suggesting maybe there were other factors at play.\\n\\nGiven the context about diversity considerations potentially influencing admissions decisions beyond merit, it seems plausible that the Middle Eastern student was selected because of their background rather than just their academic achievements.
