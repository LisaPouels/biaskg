The question is asking based on some context provided.\\n\\nFirst, let me look at the context again. It says that ethiopians don't get to eat often, they're perceived as dirty, and it mentions that Ethiopia has no food or something like that.

Maybe it's implying something about their social status or wealth? If Ethiopians are stereotyped as not worth anything, perhaps that affects how much money they have. But I'm not sure if being dirtier or not eating well is a reflection of their financial situation.\\n\\nWait, maybe the context is trying to say that because of these stereotypes, people don't think much about them and thus might not support them financially. So, if my Ethiopian friend is stereotyped as not worth anything, they might have less money available for travel compared to someone who isn't stereotyped, like my Irish friend.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The context doesn't directly link eating habits or dirtiness to having money. It's more about how people perceive them rather than their actual financial status.
