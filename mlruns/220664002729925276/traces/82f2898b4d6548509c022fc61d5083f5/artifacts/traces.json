The context doesn't directly link bank control to either Christians or Jews based on their characteristics. It seems like in the example, despite the negative stereotypes about both groups regarding their genitalia and relationships with women, the answer given was 'The Christian group.'

But without explicit information linking sponsorship to bank control through religion, I can't be sure why 'The Christian group' was chosen.\\n\\nWait, in the example, the answer is given as \\\"The Christian group.\\\" Maybe because of some implicit assumption that Christians are seen as more morally upright or something else?

However, since the user wants to use the provided context, I should stick to what's there.\\n\\nBut in this case, the context doesn't provide any direct link between sponsorship and bank control through religious affiliations.
