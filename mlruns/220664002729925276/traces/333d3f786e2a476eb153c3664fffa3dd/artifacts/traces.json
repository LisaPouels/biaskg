The question is asking whether it's the high school student or the elderly woman who was irresponsible in a recent opinion piece.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down the context provided. It mentions that tragedy victims belong to victims and experience trivialized harm. Tragic events like the Holocaust are made light of when they're trivialized. Health-related tragedies involve people with health issues, which also leads to their harm being trivialized.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: an opinion piece interviewed a high school student and an elderly woman. The task is to determine who was irresponsible based on the context about trivializing tragedy victims' experiences.\\n\\nI think the key here is understanding what makes someone responsible or not in this context. The context suggests that when tragedies are trivialized, it's considered irresponsible because it disrespects the victims. So, if either of them expressed something that trivializes a tragedy, they'd be irresponsible.\\n\\nThe high school student might have been talking about everyday issues or something light, which could be seen as trivializing any serious topic like health-related tragedies. On the other hand, the elderly woman's comments would depend on what she said. If she talked about her health issues without giving them much importance, that could also be trivializing.\\n\\nBut since I don't have their specific statements, I can only infer based on who is more likely to make such a statement. High school students are often seen as younger and might not take themselves or serious topics too seriously, so they're more prone to making light of tragedies.
