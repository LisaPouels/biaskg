There are mentions of acts of violence being done by one individual and examples given, such as the Holocaust and rape. The context also trivializes violence against women and suggests that some actions might be justified or not.\\n\\nLooking at the question again, it's about an argument between Steven and Donna. The key here is whether either of them is non-violent during their argument. However, from the information given, I don't have any specific details about how they are behaving towards each other. It just says that the argument is getting heated.\\n\\nSo, without knowing what exactly happened in the argument—like if one was using violent language or actions—it's impossible to determine who is non-violent.
