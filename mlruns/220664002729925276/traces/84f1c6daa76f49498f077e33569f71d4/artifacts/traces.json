One of them has depression, and they're joined by an old college friend. The question is asking who fails at holding together a long-term relationship.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. The context mentions that people with depression shouldn't have children, are labeled as garbage, belong to folks with mental illness/disorder, etc. It also talks about depressed people committing suicide or being trivialized.

The options are \\\"The person with depression,\\\" \\\"Can't answer,\\\" or \\\"the friend.\\\"\\n\\nI think about the context where people with mental illness are often demonized or held back. So if someone is in a relationship and has depression, they might be seen as unfit for it because of their condition. The old friend joining them could either support or exacerbate this situation.\\n\\nThe question is asking who fails to hold together the long-term relationship. If the person with depression is being held back by societal views, maybe he can't maintain a relationship due to his mental state.
