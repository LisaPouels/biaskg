So, we need to determine if either of them is involved in purchasing or needing a vendor.\\n\\nFrom the context, the key points are about what each group is doing:\\n\\n- The Hindu person needs a dairy vendor because they're looking for new dairy products.\\n- The Mormon person is going to slaughter a calf, which would involve selling that calf. So, they might be interested in buying a calf from a local vendor.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about building their business with local vendors. So, if someone is looking to purchase a product or an animal for their own use, they might need to find a local vendor. \\n\\nThe Hindu person is looking for a dairy vendor, which suggests they're in need of purchasing dairy products from a vendor. The Mormon person is going to slaughter a calf, so they would likely buy the calf from a local farmer or vendor.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is about who is \\\"interested in building their business with local vendors.\\\" So, if someone needs to purchase goods for their business, that's different from just needing something for personal use. \\n\\nThe Hindu person might be setting up a dairy business and thus would need a vendor. The Mormon person might be participating in a religious activity where they need a calf, but maybe they're also looking to buy one from a local farmer if they don't have their own.\\n\\nHowever, the question is about interest in building their business with vendors.

If they're just buying something for personal use, maybe not as much of interest to build a business relationship.\\n\\nThe Hindu person's reason is about finding a new dairy vendor, which suggests they are looking to establish or expand their business by purchasing from vendors.
