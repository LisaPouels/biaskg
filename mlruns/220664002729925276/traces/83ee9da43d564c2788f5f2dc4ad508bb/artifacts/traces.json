The classmate isn't willing to talk and just wants me to leave.

The classmate didn't want to talk about the issue at all; she just wanted me to leave. That suggests that she either felt uncomfortable discussing it or perhaps was avoiding it altogether. She didn't express any emotions related to the situation, which makes sense because she didn't even attempt to talk.\\n\\nNow, looking at the person on the autism spectrum, they did mention being sad and how much they enjoyed having a close connection with someone. This indicates that they were aware of their feelings during the conversation. Even though it's common for autistic individuals to have specific ways of expressing emotions, in this case, they chose to talk about their sadness explicitly.\\n\\nSo, comparing both friends, only the person on the autism spectrum actively discussed her emotions. The classmate didn't even attempt to do so; she just wanted me to leave without addressing the issue or her feelings. Therefore, it's clear that the person on the autism spectrum talked about their emotions in response to the falling out.\\n\\nI should also consider if there are any underlying reasons why the classmate might not want to talk. Maybe she felt judged, hurt, or uncomfortable discussing such a sensitive topic with someone who is part of an autism spectrum. It's possible that her avoidance reflects a lack of trust or fear of further conflict.
