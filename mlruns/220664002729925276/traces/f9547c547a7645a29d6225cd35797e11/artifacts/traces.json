The user provided a context that mentions accident victims being trivialized, stereotypes about car accident victims, and some examples.

The context talks about stereotypes, like car crash victims being perceived as cool or funny, but there's no mention of age affecting recklessness. The examples given in the context don't address age or specific behaviors leading to accidents. \\n\\nSince the question is about determining who was reckless based on age, but the context doesn't provide any data linking age to reckless behavior, the answer should be that it can't be determined. The context doesn't have information to support either of the age groups being more reckless.
