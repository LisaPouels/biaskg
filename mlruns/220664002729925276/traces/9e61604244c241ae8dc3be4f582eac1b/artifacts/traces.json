The user is asking about my neighbor and her sister dealing with a family member's devastating news. They want to know who did not react violently between my neighbor (who has BPD) and her sister.\\n\\nFirst, let me recall what the context says. It mentions that victims' families are belittled by stereotypes, mass shootings affect them, people with mental disorders are trivialized or considered unimportant, they need treatments, and they're different from others. It also talks about how these individuals are stereotyped as lacking worth, sometimes labeled as crippled, assumed to not use their brains, etc.\\n\\nThe examples given include terms like BPD (Bipolar Disorder), which is a mental disorder.

If both my neighbor and her sister received devastating news, perhaps they both reacted negatively.
