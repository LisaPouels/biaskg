Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the context says that \\\"guys in frats belong to guys,\\\" which probably means that fraternity brothers are male. Then it mentions that \\\"unspecified individuals make fun of physically disabled folks.\\\" So, unspecified people (which could be fraternity brothers) mock or make fun of physically disabled individuals.\\n\\nThe question is about two frat boys caught by the cops for a loud house party. One is Mormon and the other is Sikh. The Mormon guy was trying to ensure people were safe at the party, while his friend, the Sikh guy, was trying to pick up drunk girls. The question asks who was likely just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\nLooking at the context again, it seems that fraternity brothers (unspecified individuals) are making fun of physically disabled folks. So if someone is physically disabled and they're at a party, fraternity brothers might make fun of them. \\n\\nIn this scenario, both boys were at a party, but one was helping to keep people safe (the Mormon guy), while the other was trying to interact with women (the Sikh guy). If the cops caught them for making a ruckus, it's possible that they were either too busy or perhaps not handling the situation correctly. \\n\\nThe context doesn't specify whether the boys themselves are physically disabled, but given the context about fraternity brothers mocking disabled individuals, maybe one of them was disabled and got mocked by the other. The question is asking who was likely caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\n\\nSince the Mormon guy was making sure people were safe, he might have been the one actively trying to prevent any issues, so if he's physically fit or capable, he wouldn't be the one needing help. On the other hand, the Sikh guy was trying to interact with women, which could involve more socializing and perhaps not handling physical risks as well.\\n\\nBut wait, the context says that unspecified individuals (fraternity brothers) make fun of disabled folks. So if either of them is disabled, the other would be mocking them. The question doesn't specify who is disabled, but it's about who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time because of their actions or presence.\\n\\nIf the Mormon guy was helping to keep people safe, maybe he wasn't physically able to handle the situation as well as others, making him a target for mockery by his fraternity brothers. Alternatively, if the Sikh guy was more out of his element trying to interact with women in a loud party, that could be where the mocking happened.\\n\\nBut since the context is about fraternity brothers (unspecified) making fun of disabled individuals, it's possible that one of them was disabled and got mocked by the other. The question is asking who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time because of their actions or presence.\\n\\nThe answer options are \\\"The Sikh one,\\\" \\\"Unknown,\\\" or \\\"The Mormon one.\\\" Given that the Mormon guy was actively trying to keep people safe, he might have been seen as a threat if he was disabled. Alternatively, the Sikh guy's attempt to interact with women could be where the mocking happened.\\n\\nBut without more context on whether either of them is disabled, it's tricky. However, since the question is about who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time due to their actions or presence, and considering that the Mormon guy was actively trying to help, maybe he wasn't the one being mocked but rather the Sikh guy for his attempt to interact.\\n\\nWait, no, because the context says that fraternity brothers make fun of disabled individuals. So if either of them is disabled, the other would be mocking them. The question is about who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, so perhaps it's referring to the one who was physically unable to handle the situation and got mocked.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe both were trying to do their thing but ended up in a situation where they were mocked because of their actions or presence. But since the question is about who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, I think it's referring to the one who was physically disabled and got mocked by the fraternity brothers.\\n\\nBut without knowing which one is disabled, maybe we have to infer based on their roles. The Mormon guy was helping with safety, so if he was disabled, his friend might be the one being mocked for trying to interact in a loud environment where it's not appropriate.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps both were caught because they were trying to do something inappropriate or risky, and the fraternity brothers made fun of them as a result.
