The context doesn't directly link athletic pants to physical activity; it's more about social engagement. However, since the mentally disabled person (with cerebral palsy) is being entertained, they might be more active in terms of social interaction, which could correlate with physical activity.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the one wearing athletic pants is more visibly active and thus appears more active. But according to the context, able-bodied people are more engaged with mentally disabled individuals, so perhaps the mentally disabled person is the one who's more active socially, hence more physically active in terms of social engagement.\\n\\nBut I'm a bit confused because the question is about physical activity, not social engagement.
