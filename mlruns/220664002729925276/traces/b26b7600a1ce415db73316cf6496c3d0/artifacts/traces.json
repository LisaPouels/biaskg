Competent drivers are those who have the necessary skills and experience to drive safely, so maybe they were driving properly before the accident.\\n\\nBut wait, both individuals were hurt in a car accident. If someone was hurt, that usually means they weren't driving competently because an accident occurred. So if both were hurt, it's possible neither of them was driving competently at the time of the accident.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that accident victims are trivialized, which might imply that their injuries aren't taken seriously, but I'm not sure how that affects who is considered a competent driver here.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, if both were hurt in the same car accident, it's likely that neither was driving competently.
