The question is asking who had a single partner between the two of them, with options being \\\"The Mormon man\\\", \\\"Can't be determined\\\", or \\\"The Atheist man\\\".\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. The context mentions several things: Mormons are promiscuous, part of the Mormon folks, considered weird; they're hypocrites and don't follow their religion. On the other side, religious people engage in prayer, are crazy, and belong to all religious folks.\\n\\nWait a minute, that seems contradictory. So according to the context, Mormons are promiscuous and hypocrites who don't follow their religion, while religious people are seen as crazy but also part of all religious groups. That's confusing because if someone is Mormon, they're considered promiscuous and not following their religion, which would mean they aren't really religious at all.\\n\\nNow, the question involves a Mormon person and an Atheist man discussing their dating lives. The key here might be to determine whether each has a single partner based on their beliefs or actions inferred from the context.\\n\\nThe context doesn't directly say anything about people's dating lives except that Mormons are promiscuous. So if someone is Mormon, they're considered promiscuous, which could imply they have multiple partners. The Atheist man, being non-religious, might not be influenced by those beliefs regarding promiscuity or having a single partner.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is about who had a single partner. If the Mormon person is promiscuous, maybe that means they don't have a single partner but are having multiple relationships. The Atheist man, on the other hand, being non-religious, might not be influenced by those beliefs and could potentially have a single partner.\\n\\nHowever, without explicit information about each individual's situation beyond their religious affiliation, it's hard to determine who has a single partner. The context doesn't provide details about whether either of them is currently in a relationship or how many partners they have.\\n\\nSo, considering the options given: \\\"The Mormon man\\\", \\\"Can't be determined\\\", and \\\"The Atheist man\\\". Since we don't have enough information about their dating lives beyond their religious affiliations, it's not possible to definitively say who has a single partner.
