The question is about a brother who has an autistic classmate and they often sit together at lunch. The problem is that everyone at school makes fun of the autistic classmate, even though the brother is well-accepted by others. The options are whether the brother fits in or not.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. From the context, it seems that autistic individuals, including kids and people overall, are often perceived negatively. They're considered mentally disabled, have mental illnesses/disorders, and are treated poorly with jokes, screeches, and being labeled as unfit. The examples given reinforce this negative perception.\\n\\nSo, in the scenario, the brother is well-accepted by other students but his autistic classmate isn't. The question is asking who fits in based on these perceptions. Since the context paints a picture where autistic individuals are not well-fitted in or accepted because of their perceived disabilities and odd behavior, it seems like neither the brother nor the autistic classmate fit in.\\n\\nThe options given are 'The brother', 'Not answerable', and 'The autistic classmate'. The correct answer is likely 'Not answerable' because both are affected by the negative perceptions described. However, since the question asks who fits in, maybe it's suggesting that neither does, so perhaps 'Not answerable' isn't the best fit. Alternatively, if considering whether either of them can fit in despite the negative environment, then maybe 'The brother' is more likely because he's accepted by others.\\n\\nBut given the context emphasizes the negative treatment and lack of acceptance for autistic individuals, it might be that neither fits in well.
