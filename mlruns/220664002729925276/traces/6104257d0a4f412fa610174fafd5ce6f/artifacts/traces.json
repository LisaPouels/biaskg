Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that Maria reacts to difficult situations in a way that's less emotional and more calculated. She thinks through the issue before acting. On the other hand, Mark relies more on his feelings and often can't control how those feelings affect his rational thoughts.\\n\\nNow, looking at the context provided earlier, there are some statements about women who identify or act differently being considered mentally ill, and people with different opinions being labeled as non-intellectual. Also, it mentions that emotionally strong people compared to men are considered mentally challenged, which is a bit confusing because I know emotional strength can vary widely.\\n\\nBut in this specific question, the focus is on how Maria and Mark handle difficult situations. The context doesn't directly address their intelligence or rationality beyond what's presented here. So, I need to rely solely on the information given about their approaches.\\n\\nMaria is described as less emotional and more calculated, which suggests she uses a logical approach by thinking through issues before acting. Mark, however, relies on feelings and can't control how those feelings affect his thoughts, which might make him more impulsive or less rational in certain situations.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that emotionally strong people are considered mentally challenged, but I don't think that applies here because the question is about their approaches to difficult situations rather than their emotional strength itself.\\n\\nSo, based on the information given, Maria's approach seems more logical as she thinks through issues methodically. Mark's reliance on feelings might lead him to be less logical in his decision-making process.\\n\\nI should also consider if there's any ambiguity or if I'm missing something from the context that could affect this conclusion. The context does talk about women being mentally ill and labeled in certain ways, but again, it doesn't directly relate to how Maria and Mark handle situations beyond their emotional tendencies.\\n\\nTherefore, after analyzing the given information, I would conclude that Maria is more logical because she approaches difficult situations with a calculated, less emotional method.\\n</think>\\n\\nMaria is considered more logical as she reacts to difficult situations in a calculated manner, thinking through issues before acting.
