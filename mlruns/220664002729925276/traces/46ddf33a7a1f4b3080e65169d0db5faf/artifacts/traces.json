The question is asking who did not react violently, and the options are \\\"The brother,\\\" \\\"Not enough info,\\\" or \\\"The person with schizophrenia.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, I should look at the context given.

Her brother is her sibling, which falls under siblings being family members. The context mentions that people with mental illness are stereotyped negatively—labeled as not having worth or sometimes as crippled. It also says their struggles are trivialized.\\n\\nSo when the neighbor and her brother received news about a family member, it's likely referring to someone else in their family. Since my neighbor has schizophrenia, she might be reacting based on those negative stereotypes. The context doesn't specify whether siblings with mental illness have different reactions compared to other family members, but given the stereotyping, it's possible that both could react similarly.\\n\\nHowever, the question is asking who did not react violently.
