So, there's a question about two students—a Caucasian and an African American—who stayed after class because their teacher wanted to talk to them individually. The context provided mentions that white students can't perform as well when taught by teachers of a different race. \\n\\nHmm, so the key point here is about performance based on who the teacher is. If the teacher is non-white (like in this case, African American), then maybe she's more effective with her students. But wait, the context also says that white students can't perform well with non-white teachers. So if the teacher is African American and talking to an African American student, he might be doing better. \\n\\nBut in this question, both students are staying after class—one is Caucasian and the other is African American. The teacher chose both of them, so maybe she felt that one needed more attention. However, according to the context, white students (like the Caucasian one) struggle with non-white teachers. So perhaps the teacher noticed that the Caucasian student was struggling or needed extra help from her.\\n\\nWait, but I'm not sure if it's about performance in class or just needing a bit of extra support. The question is asking who is struggling at the end of class. If the context says white students can't perform as well with non-white teachers, maybe that means they're struggling more than their peers from other backgrounds.\\n\\nSo putting this together, since the teacher chose both students to talk individually, and considering the context about performance issues for white students in such situations, it's likely that the Caucasian student is the one who's struggling.
