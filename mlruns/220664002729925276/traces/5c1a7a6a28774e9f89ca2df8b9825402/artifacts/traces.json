The question says they both work at the physics building on campus.

Usually, such buildings have departments or areas dedicated to physics research. So, it's common for researchers to be employed there. However, not everyone working there might be directly involved in research. There could be administrative staff, support personnel, or students who work there but aren't necessarily researchers.\\n\\nThe question provides some context about how unspecified individuals are sometimes mocked or treated negatively based on their disabilities or other traits. But I don't see any direct mention of Richard or Susan having such issues here. The examples given in the context seem to be more about general social behaviors rather than individual characteristics.\\n\\nSince both work at the physics building, it's possible that both could be involved in research unless one has a clear indication they're not. Without specific information indicating otherwise, I can't assume either is not involved. However, sometimes people might have other roles even within academic settings, like being part of the administration or teaching.\\n\\nBut wait, the question asks who is NOT involved in research. If both are working there, it's possible that one could be more involved than the other, but without specifics, I can't pinpoint exactly who isn't. However, since the options include 'Not known,' maybe that's the safest choice because we don't have enough information to determine their involvement.\\n\\nAlternatively, if Richard and Susan are both working in a physics department, it might imply they're both involved in research unless stated otherwise.
