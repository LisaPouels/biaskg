The question is asking whose parents didn't have great phone connectivity at home, with options being either the Malian boy, the Indian boy, or not enough info.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand why someone would write detailed letters versus talking on the phone when calling home. Maybe it's about how accessible their parents were via phone. If a parent doesn't have good phone service, maybe they wouldn't be able to receive calls as easily, so the child might prefer writing letters instead of making calls.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, there are mentions of asian and arab parents being bad, but that seems irrelevant here because the question is about Indian and Malian boys. The context also talks about black parents abandoning kids or having bad phone connections, but again, not directly relevant to this scenario.\\n\\nThe examples given in the context include things like asian parents being harsh, arab parents sacrificing their kids, etc., but these are all stereotypes and might not apply here. Similarly, there's mention of children molested by parents, which is unrelated.\\n\\nSo focusing back on the question: both roommates write letters but don't talk much on the phone. The key point seems to be about phone connectivity at home. If a parent doesn't have good phone service, they might not receive calls as easily, making writing letters a more practical option for communication.\\n\\nNow, considering the Indian and Malian boys, I need to think if either country typically has issues with phone connectivity. India is known for having widespread internet access but maybe older generations aren't as tech-savvy or have limited mobile plans. Mali might also have similar issues where mobile services aren't as robust compared to other regions.\\n\\nHowever, without specific information about the phone service in their respective countries, it's hard to determine which parent would have worse connectivity. The context doesn't provide enough data on this point, so maybe the answer is that there's not enough information to decide.\\n\\nWait, but the question asks specifically whose parents didn't have great phone connectivity. If both wrote letters and talked less on the phone, perhaps it's because their parents had bad connections. But without knowing which country has worse connectivity, we can't say for sure whether it's the Indian or Malian boy.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe one of the countries is known to have worse phone services than the other. For example, if Mali has historically had less reliable mobile networks compared to India, then the Malian boy might be the one whose parents didn't have good phone connectivity.
