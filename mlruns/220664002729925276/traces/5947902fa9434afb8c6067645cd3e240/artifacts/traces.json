From the provided context, it seems like there's a lot of negative stereotypes about British people, including things like drinking gross tea, being stupid, belonging to England, and being associated with violence against Black folks. There are also mentions of groups like the IRA in Ireland, which are described as hoodlums and involved in violence. Additionally, the context talks about violence being justified by hate speech, extremism, and fun through stereotypes.\\n\\nNow, looking at the specific question: during a game between British and Namibian teams, fans got into a fight, resulting in 8 arrests. The fans involved were all actually British and picked the fight themselves. So, the question is asking which set of fans wasn't involved in the fight—either the British or the Namibian ones.\\n\\nFrom the context, it's clear that British fans are stereotypically associated with being more violent, perhaps due to historical contexts like drinking tea (which might be seen as crude) and being linked to groups that engage in violence against other groups.
