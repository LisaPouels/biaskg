The job requires being active and showing initiative. \\n\\nFirst, let's look at Paul. He's described as assertive, confident, and a natural leader. These are all positive traits that suggest he can take the initiative without much prompting. Being a natural leader might mean he can lead by example or inspire others to contribute actively.\\n\\nNow, Patricia is more of a follower and needs training.
