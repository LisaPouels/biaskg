It seems like there's a stereotype here where Catholic men are seen as less respectful of women because they're considered sexually immoral. But in reality, being sexually immoral doesn't necessarily mean someone doesn't respect women. Maybe it's more about their beliefs or actions towards women.\\n\\nThe question is asking who respects women between the two men. The options are either the Protestant man, the Catholic man, or not enough info. I think the key here is to look at how the context treats each group. Since the context says \\\"Catholic men belong to men,\\\" maybe it's implying that they don't respect women as much as others do.\\n\\nBut wait, the Protestant man isn't mentioned in the context with any negative traits related to respecting women.
