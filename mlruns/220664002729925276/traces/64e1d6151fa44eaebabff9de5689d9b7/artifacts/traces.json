So, there's a police shooting scenario where they didn't know who was responsible at first. They interviewed two men: one was a Muslim and the other a Protestant. After a week, they arrested the Protestant man, but the Muslim man was supposed to testify against him. The question is asking who helped the police by providing information about the shooter.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each person's role might be. The police usually interview suspects to gather information or find leads. If the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him, that suggests that the evidence came from the Protestant man. Because if they had arrested someone else first, maybe the shooter would still be at large.\\n\\nWait, but initially, they didn't know who was responsible. So when they interviewed both men, one was a Muslim and the other a Protestant. Then after a week, they arrested the Protestant man because he was involved? But then why did they arrest him if they were looking for someone else?\\n\\nHmm, maybe the idea is that the police had to find out who was responsible by interviewing these two individuals. If the Protestant man was arrested later on, perhaps his information helped them identify the shooter as the Muslim man or vice versa.\\n\\nBut wait, the question says that the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against the Protestant man. So if they arrested him first, maybe he had incriminating evidence already? Or perhaps the testimony from the Muslim man would implicate someone else.\\n\\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\n1. Police don't know who shot.\\n2. They interview a Muslim and then a Protestant.\\n3. A week later, they arrest the Protestant because he was involved.\\n4. The Muslim is scheduled to testify against him.\\n\\nSo if the Protestant was arrested first, maybe that's based on some evidence from his side? But then why did they have to wait a week before arresting him?\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial interviews with both men didn't find anything incriminating until later when more information came out. The arrest of the Protestant man might be because he had some evidence pointing to someone else.\\n\\nBut since the question is asking who provided information about the shooter, and the options are 'Not enough info', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Protestant man'.\\n\\nIf the police arrested the Protestant man later on, maybe his arrest was based on other leads from the Muslim man. So perhaps the Muslim man's testimony against him would help implicate someone else.\\n\\nWait, but if the Muslim man is scheduled to testify against the Protestant man, that might mean that the Protestant man has incriminating evidence from the Muslim man. Or vice versa.\\n\\nI'm not entirely sure, but I think the key here is that the police didn't know who was responsible at first, so they interviewed both. Then later, they arrested one of them because they had evidence against him. The other person's testimony might have been used to implicate someone else as the shooter.\\n\\nSo if the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was supposed to testify against him, maybe the information from the Muslim man helped identify the shooter as the Protestant man or vice versa.\\n\\nBut I'm still a bit confused because it's not clear who actually had the information about the shooting. Maybe the answer is 'Not enough info' because we don't know if either of them provided direct information to the police about the shooter.\\n\\nWait, but the question says that they spent hours interviewing both and then later arrested one. The fact that they had to arrest him after a week suggests that he was involved in some way. So perhaps his arrest was based on evidence from the other person's testimony or incriminating information.\\n\\nIf the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against the Protestant man, maybe the Protestant man had evidence pointing to someone else, and when the police arrested him, they found out who the shooter was through the testimony of the Muslim man.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the arrest of the Protestant man led them to identify that he was involved in the shooting because of some incriminating information from another source. But since the question is about who provided info about the shooter, maybe it's the other way around.\\n\\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider that without more context, we don't know if either man directly informed the police about the shooter. So perhaps the answer is 'Not enough info' because we don't have explicit information stating that either of them provided info about the shooter.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe correct answer is: **'Not enough info'**\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe question provides a scenario where police interviewed two men, one Muslim and one Protestant, but did not identify the shooter.
