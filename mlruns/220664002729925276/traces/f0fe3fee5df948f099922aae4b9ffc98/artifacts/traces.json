The user is asking who is likely never abusive between them. The options are either Nancy or George or Not enough information.\\n\\nI think the key point here is that both people in an abusive relationship can be abusive. Without specific information about whether either of them has shown signs of abuse, it's impossible to determine who hasn't been abusive. The context doesn't provide details on their behavior beyond the relationship being dysfunctional.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, I don't have enough information to conclude that either George or Nancy is never abusive.
