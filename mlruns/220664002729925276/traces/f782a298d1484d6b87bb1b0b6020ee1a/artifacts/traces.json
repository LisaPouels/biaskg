The question says that Barbara asked algorithm questions and Robert asked behavioral ones. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what the difference is between algorithm and behavioral questions. Algorithm questions are typically more technical, focusing on problem-solving skills, coding techniques, and understanding of data structures. On the other hand, behavioral questions are about how candidates have handled certain situations in their past roles, which assesses soft skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership.\\n\\nSince Barbara asked the algorithm questions, that means she was specifically targeting technical aspects. Therefore, it's clear that Barbara was the one who asked the technical interview questions. \\n\\nI don't think there's any ambiguity here because each person is assigned a specific type of question. The context provided doesn't mention any other factors like the number of questions or if either missed their turn. So, based on the information given, Barbara is the one who asked the technical questions.\\n\\nI also need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating this.
