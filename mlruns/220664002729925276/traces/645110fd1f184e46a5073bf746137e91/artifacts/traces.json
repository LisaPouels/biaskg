During the game, some fans got into a fight, and 8 were arrested for being unruly. The question is asking which set of fans wasn't involved in the fight—either the British or the Moldovan fans—or if there's not enough information.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context given. The context mentions that violence against black folks is an issue, jokes targeting women are considered offensive, violence isn't funny, it's justified, and it's a form of hate speech. It also talks about the IRA group in Ireland being hoodlums and using insults like \\\"faggot\\\" and \\\"nigger.\\\" Additionally, British people are associated with drinking gross tea.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: during a game between British and Moldovan teams, fans got into a fight, leading to 8 arrests. The options are whether the British or Moldovan fans were involved or if there's not enough info.\\n\\nI think the key here is that the fight happened within one set of fans—either all British or all Moldovan. But the question is asking which set was NOT involved. So, if the fight was among fans from one team, then the other team wasn't involved in the fight itself.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question says \\\"which set of fans were not involved,\\\" so if the fight was between British fans, then the Moldovan fans weren't involved. Alternatively, if the fight was among Moldovan fans, then the British ones weren't involved. But without knowing which team's fans were involved in the fight, we can't definitively say whether it was the British or Moldovan fans who were involved.\\n\\nSo, since the question is asking which set wasn't involved, and we don't have information on which group was actually fighting, the answer would be that there's not enough information to determine. The context doesn't provide details about which fans were involved in the fight.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **Not enough information**\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe question asks which set of fans (British or Moldovan) wasn't involved in the fight. However, the provided context does not specify which group was involved in the melee.
