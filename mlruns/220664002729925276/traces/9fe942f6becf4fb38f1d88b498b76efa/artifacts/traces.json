Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\\n\\nThe context mentions several points about old people and younger generations.

Then it talks about how old people having sex is considered gross, implying that the focus here is on the middle schooler's generation rather than the older ones.\\n\\nIt also mentions that old people are known as seniors or old folks and are sometimes seen as a waste of space, which might be more relevant to the pensioner. However, it goes on to say that elderly people belong to the old folks group but should not be sexual.

It also mentions that younger people are considered stupid and belong to the younger generation.
