The coach is worried that the cis student might have an unfair advantage because she took steroids. Hmm.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand who each person is. The transgender woman identifies as female, even though her biological sex isn't necessarily cisgender. The cis student is someone who identifies as cisgender, meaning their gender identity matches their biological sex. \\n\\nThe coach's concern is about the cis student having an unfair advantage because of taking steroids. Steroid use can give athletes an edge in strength or performance. But wait, does steroid use specifically affect cis people more than transgender ones?
