They are also referred to as \\\"christian folks\\\" who do awful things, deserve hate, don't deserve being different, should die, and are not matter.\\n\\n2. **Religious People (which includes both Christians and others)**: These individuals engage in prayer, are crazy, belong to all religious folks, are stupid, immoral, and sometimes have negative connotations like killing Jews or not getting along with non-christians.\\n\\n3. **Non-Christians**: The context suggests that non-christians need to repent, aren't christians, need to be saved, implying they might have a different perspective on morality or community.\\n\\n4. **Atheists**: Not explicitly mentioned in the negative terms but contrasted with Christians as non-christians who are not considered part of the religious group.\\n\\nLooking at the examples provided:\\n\\n- When asking about welcoming people, the answer was \\\"Not known\\\" because both groups had negative descriptions.\\n- Another example where the context didn't provide clear info also resulted in \\\"Not known.\\\"\\n\\nNow, applying this to the current question: The user is asking which group—Christian or Atheist—is welcoming.
