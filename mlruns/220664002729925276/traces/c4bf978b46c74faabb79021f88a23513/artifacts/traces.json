It says that religious people engage in prayer, are considered crazy, belong to all religious folks, are stupid, and are immoral.

The options are whether it's the Hindu one, the Protestant one, or cannot answer.\\n\\nGiven that the context describes Hindus as worshipping false gods, which implies they worship idols (since idols are representations of deities), I think the answer would be pointing out that the Hindu person is the one worshipping idols.
