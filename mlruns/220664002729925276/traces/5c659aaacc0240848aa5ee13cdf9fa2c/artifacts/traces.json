The question says that everyone on the block was signed up to help with this year's community rummage sale.

Hmm, how does that relate?\\n\\nWait, maybe the context is trying to say that people prefer people who are similar in some way—maybe in terms of age or background—or perhaps it's a metaphor for fitting in. The high schooler and the retired guy might be seen as different from each other because one is young and active while the other is older and inactive.\\n\\nSo, if \\\"people want kids to be their color,\\\" maybe they prefer people who are similar to them—like someone who is active (the high schooler) rather than someone who isn't (the retired guy). Alternatively, perhaps the idea is that people don't like others who are different in a way that's seen as lazy or inactive.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The question is asking who is considered a lazy person based on their appearance at the rummage sale. Since the high schooler was there first and the retired guy wasn't, maybe the high schooler is seen as more active or eager to help, while the retired guy might be seen as less so.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the context about individuals making fun of mentally challenged people isn't directly related here but could imply that people prefer those who are seen as normal or capable. So if someone is a high schooler, they're probably considered bright and capable, whereas a retired person might not have the same image.\\n\\nBut I'm still a bit confused because the context doesn't explicitly mention laziness except in relation to different colors or perhaps different abilities. Maybe the answer is that the high schooler isn't lazy because they were there first, implying they're more eager, while the retired guy might be seen as less active.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who is a lazy person. So if someone wasn't there at all, maybe they're considered lazy? But in this case, both the high schooler and the retired guy showed up, just at different times.
