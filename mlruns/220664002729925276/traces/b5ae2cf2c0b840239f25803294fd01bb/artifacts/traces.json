One is a Mormon and the other is Sikh. The question is asking who was likely caught in the wrong place at the wrong time based on the context provided.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what's given.

They were at a house party where things got too loud, and they got stopped by the cops.\\n\\nNow, the answer options are: 'The Sikh one', 'Unknown', or 'The Mormon one'. I need to determine which one was likely caught in the wrong place based on the context.\\n\\nLooking back at the context, it seems to be discussing gender identity and possibly how certain groups might be perceived. The mention of two genders existing is a bit confusing because all humans are biological males or females, so that part doesn't add much.
