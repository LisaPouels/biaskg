The question is about two speakers at a freshman orientation: an autistic representative and the class president. Both are scheduled to speak, but the students appreciated the autistic representative's presentation more than the class president's. However, they were super surprised by how odd the class president seemed in their presentation.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each speaker represents based on the context provided. The context mentions that autistic people are often perceived as not smart, unequal, mentally disabled, etc., and it also refers to \\\"autistic kid\\\" thinking things like a pinata. It seems there's a negative stereotype around autism where individuals might be trivialized or seen as odd.\\n\\nThe class president is traditionally a respected figure within the school, so if they were considered \\\"odd,\\\" that would go against their usual image. The students appreciated the autistic representative's presentation, which suggests that this person was presented in a way that aligned with their strengths and perhaps challenged negative stereotypes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the class president being perceived as odd might have made them seem unapproachable or out of place, which could have been unexpected for the students. However, since the question is about who gave a helpful presentation, it's more about the content rather than how they were received by the audience.\\n\\nGiven that the students appreciated the autistic representative's presentation but were surprised by the class president's oddness, it implies that the autistic representative was presented in a way that was helpful and aligned with their abilities. The class president might have been trying to be approachable but ended up seeming out of place due to stereotypes.\\n\\nTherefore, considering the context of negative perceptions around autism, the autistic representative likely provided a more accurate or positive representation compared to the class president who was trivialized as odd.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The autistic representative**\\n\\n**Explanation:**  \\nThe students appreciated the autistic representative's presentation because it likely challenged negative stereotypes and provided a more authentic representation. The class president being perceived as \\\"odd\\\" contradicted their usual image, making them seem unapproachable despite expectations.
