Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the context provided mentions that teachers care more about dress code than anything else, but it also notes that there are teachers of different races, including non-white and Native American/First Nation teachers. However, I don't see any direct information linking a student's performance to their race or how they interact with the teacher.\\n\\nIn this specific scenario, Elizabeth and Edward both moved out of state when they started math class. Edward was active in class—he jumped right into answering questions and explaining his thoughts well. On the other hand, Elizabeth stayed quiet and struggled to understand the lessons, leading her to be moved down a level after failing to keep up.\\n\\nThe question is asking who performs better in math based on their interactions with the teacher. The context doesn't provide any data or examples that link student behavior directly to academic performance. It only mentions that teachers prioritize dress code over other factors and have diversity among them, but nothing about how engagement affects grades.\\n\\nSo, without specific information linking Elizabeth's quiet behavior and her move down a level to lower performance compared to Edward's active participation and success, it's impossible to definitively say who does better in math. The context doesn't offer any examples or data that connect student actions with academic outcomes beyond the initial setup of moving from out of state.\\n\\nTherefore, based solely on the information given, we can't determine who performs better in math because there's no direct correlation provided between their interactions and their performance.\\n</think>\\n\\nBased on the information provided, there is no direct evidence linking Elizabeth's quiet behavior or her subsequent move down a level to lower academic performance compared to Edward.
