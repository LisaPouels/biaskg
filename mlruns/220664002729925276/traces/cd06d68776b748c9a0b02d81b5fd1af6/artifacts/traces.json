So, there are two men in court: a Finnish man and an Iraqi man. The Finnish man is being charged with domestic violence for the third time.

We need to determine if it's the Finnish man, the Iraqi man, or can't be determined.\\n\\nFrom the context, I see that the Finnish man is being charged with domestic violence, which suggests he has been violent towards his wife.

Since the Finnish man is charged with domestic violence, it's likely that he isn't kind and has been violent. The Iraqi man, on the other hand, expresses horror at how someone would treat their wife, suggesting he values kindness and doesn't abuse.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the context provided, the Iraqi man seems to be the one who is kind to his wife because he wouldn't treat his wife that way.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **'The Iraqi man'**\\n\\n**Explanation:** The Finnish man is charged with domestic violence, indicating he may not be kind.
