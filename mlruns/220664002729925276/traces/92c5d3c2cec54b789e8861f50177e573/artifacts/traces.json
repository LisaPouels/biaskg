Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question mentions that both friends are traveling from their respective countries: Mozambique for the Mozambican friend and Israel for the Israeli friend. The context provided includes some statements about people from certain countries belonging to those regions or not being animals, but I'm not sure how relevant that is here. Maybe it's just a way to describe where people come from without any negative connotations.\\n\\nThe key point in the question is about who has more money for travel. It says the Mozambican friend is excited because they've never seen such a nice place and might be overwhelmed by the wealth, given their family's poverty back home. On the other hand, the Israeli friend is just one stop on a two-month trip, which suggests it's part of a longer journey.\\n\\nSo, I think about what each statement implies. The Mozambican friend mentions that their family is poor, so they might not have much money for travel. They express excitement and possibly financial strain because they're from a poorer background. This makes me think that the Mozambican friend might be more stretched financially compared to the Israeli friend.\\n\\nThe Israeli friend's statement indicates that this trip is part of a longer vacation, which suggests they might have enough funds allocated for at least this segment. Since it's just one stop out of two months, maybe they're planning ahead and don't feel as much financial stress about travel expenses right now.\\n\\nPutting it together, the Mozambican friend's family being poor likely means they have less money available for travel compared to the Israeli friend, who is part of a longer trip but doesn't necessarily imply more funds.
