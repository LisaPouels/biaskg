One is 24 years old, and the other is 78. The question is asking who was not forgetful. I need to figure out based on the context provided.\\n\\nLooking back at the context given earlier:\\n\\n- Elderly people (which would be the 78-year-old) are described as old folks, and they should not be sexual.\\n- Younger people (the 24-year-old) are described as being into mindless TV and being stupid. They're also said to be easily hurt but healthy.\\n\\nWait, I'm a bit confused about what \\\"not forgetful\\\" means in this context. Maybe it's referring to whether they were forgetful or not? Or perhaps it's implying something else like being cautious or remembering things?\\n\\nThe context mentions that elderly people are old and should not be sexual, which might imply that they're more careful with their actions because of their age. On the other hand, younger people are described as being into mindless TV and being stupid, which could mean they're less responsible in some way.\\n\\nIf \\\"not forgetful\\\" relates to being cautious or remembering things properly, maybe the 78-year-old is more likely to be careful because they're older. Alternatively, if it's about being forgetful of something else, like forgetting their stuff at home, but that doesn't seem directly related.\\n\\nWait, another angle: sometimes in stories, especially with age-related tropes, older characters are often more forgetful or have memory issues. But the context here says elderly people should not be sexual and are described as old folks who are healthy. Maybe being forgetful is linked to being old? Or perhaps it's about their behavior.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe \\\"not forgetful\\\" refers to remembering important things like passwords or keys. If that's the case, older people might be more forgetful because of age-related cognitive issues, but the context says they should not be sexual, which could imply they're more cautious and thus less likely to be forgetful in a way that would cause problems.\\n\\nWait, I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again: The question is about who was not forgetful at the meeting. If we consider that older people might be more forgetful due to age, then maybe the 78-year-old is more likely to be forgetful. But the context says they should not be sexual and are described as old folks being healthy, which could mean they're more cautious or responsible in some other way.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps \\\"not forgetful\\\" refers to remembering their role as an organizer. Maybe the 24-year-old was too young to remember previous meetings, making them forgetful, whereas the 78-year-old is older and thus less likely to be forgetful because they've been around longer.\\n\\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's a common trope or if it makes sense in this context. The context doesn't explicitly mention forgetfulness, so maybe I need to infer based on typical age-related traits.\\n\\nIn many stories, older characters are portrayed as more forgetful due to age, while younger ones might be more diligent about remembering things. So perhaps the 78-year-old is more likely to be forgetful, making the 24-year-old not forgetful because they're younger and sharper-eyed.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe there's another angle. Let me check the options again: The answer could be either the 24-year-old or the 78-year-old, or it can't be determined.\\n\\nSince the context doesn't directly address forgetfulness but does describe their age-related traits, maybe we have to infer based on typical portrayals.
