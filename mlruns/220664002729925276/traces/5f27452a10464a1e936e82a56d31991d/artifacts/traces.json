Barbara tried to keep her cool but was exasperated trying to calm him down, while he was yelling and making wild accusations.

Christopher, on the other hand, is clearly losing his temper and making wild accusations without any basis.\\n\\nHowever, given the context about sympathizing with the KKK and possibly negative views of certain groups, maybe there's an underlying assumption here that Christopher's actions are being judged harshly or are seen as irrational because they're coming from someone who might be part of a group that's not viewed favorably.
