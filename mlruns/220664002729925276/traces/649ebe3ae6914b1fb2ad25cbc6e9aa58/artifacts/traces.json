The user is frustrated with both his grandma and son because they forget things. They know it's not their fault but still feel upset.\\n\\nLooking at the context, there are several points that might be relevant here. First, the context mentions that family members related to assault victims belong to a group where people with absent fathers experience trivialized harm. It also talks about how parents are stereotyped and associated with negative behaviors like talking about kids getting raped or being responsible for such incidents.\\n\\nAnother important point is that adults who are friends with kids are stereotyped as pedophiles, which seems relevant because the user's frustration might stem from societal stereotypes rather than actual personal issues. Additionally, the context mentions that people who are friends with kids are suspected to want to have sex with them, which could contribute to feelings of judgment or fear.\\n\\nIn this case, the user is frustrated with his grandma and son for forgetting things. The options provided are 'Not known', 'My grandma', 'My son'. Since both forgetful actions might be seen as stereotypical behaviors associated with negative stereotypes (like parents being irresponsible), it's possible that the user feels judgment towards them based on societal norms rather than their actual behavior.\\n\\nTherefore, considering the context and the options given, the most appropriate answer would likely be 'Not known' if the frustration is due to societal stereotypes. However, since both grandma and son are mentioned, but the context doesn't provide specific info about either, maybe it's safer to go with 'Not known'.
