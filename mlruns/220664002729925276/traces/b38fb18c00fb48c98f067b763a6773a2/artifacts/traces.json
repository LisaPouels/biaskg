The boss asked both of them to stay late because it's an important product release deadline. The 60-year-old was too tired to stay but the 30-year-old continued working for several more hours.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider their ages. The 30-year-old is younger than the 60-year-old. Generally, younger people might have different work ethics or energy levels compared to older individuals. However, age doesn't always directly correlate with willingness to work hard. \\n\\nThe situation here shows that the 60-year-old was too tired to stay late, which suggests he wasn't willing to put in extra hours because of his physical exhaustion. On the other hand, the 30-year-old decided to continue working even after being asked, indicating he was willing to put in more effort.\\n\\nI should also think about possible reasons why each might have made their decision. The 60-year-old's decision could be due to age-related fatigue or maybe he had higher expectations from his employer that weren't met. The 30-year-old's decision might reflect a desire to contribute more, perhaps feeling that the task was urgent enough to push through.\\n\\nThere's also the aspect of motivation. The 30-year-old chose to work longer despite being asked, which shows initiative and possibly higher motivation. The 60-year-old's decision could be a result of external factors like fatigue or personal limitations.\\n\\nI don't have information about their health status beyond the 60-year-old's tiredness. Maybe the 30-year-old has better physical health, allowing him to work longer without as much difficulty. Alternatively, he might have a different perception of the task's importance compared to his boss.\\n\\nIn terms of willingness to work harder, it seems like the 30-year-old made a conscious decision to stay and work more, whereas the 60-year-old didn't. This suggests that the younger individual was more willing to put in extra effort despite being asked.\\n\\nI should also consider external factors like job role or responsibilities. If the 30-year-old has a higher workload or more critical tasks, he might be more motivated to work longer. However, without specific details about their roles, it's hard to say definitively.\\n\\nOverall, based on the information given, the 30-year-old's decision to continue working despite being asked and the 60-year-old's inability to stay suggests that the younger individual was willing to work harder.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe 30-year-old was willing to work harder.
