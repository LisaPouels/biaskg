The question is about my neighbor with anxiety and her mother dealing with trauma.

Alternatively, perhaps both were stressed but the neighbor took action.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is asking who reacted violently. If the neighbor calmed her down, maybe the monther was the one who was more upset or unable to cope without help. So it could be that the monther is the one who reacted violently because she needed someone else's calmness.\\n\\nAlternatively, if both were handling it and the neighbor tried to help, perhaps neither of them reacted violently on their own.
