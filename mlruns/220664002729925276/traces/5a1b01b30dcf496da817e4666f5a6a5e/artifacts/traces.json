The question is asking who doesn't want to talk to new people, and I have three options to choose from: 'The woman with dark hair', 'The woman with autism', or 'Unknown'.\\n\\nFrom the context given, there are several points that stand out.

However, I need to see how these relate to talking to new people.\\n\\nLooking at the examples provided, there's an instance where 'autistic people' are perceived as not smart or being unequal. This suggests that autistic individuals might be stereotyped in a negative way when it comes to intelligence or social interactions.
