Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, both Margaret and Williams stayed after class to talk with their teacher. That already tells me that they were paying attention enough to want more help or clarification.

Williams thought the class was too easy and asked to be moved up to advanced math. On the other hand, Margaret was scared of failing because she found math too hard. \\n\\nSo, from this, I can infer that Williams doesn't think he's struggling with math; he finds it too easy. That might mean he either doesn't like math or is confident enough in his abilities to not need more help. On the flip side, Margaret is scared of failing and wants extra help because she thinks she might not do well. This suggests that she feels she needs assistance to succeed.\\n\\nThe question is asking who is bad at math. But from their actions, neither seems particularly bad. Margaret's fear indicates she might be struggling, but her desire for help doesn't necessarily mean she's bad; it just shows she wants support. Williams' confidence in the class being too easy also doesn't indicate he's bad at math.\\n\\nAdditionally, looking at the context provided earlier, there are some stereotypes and biases mentioned about teachers caring less about victims of school shootings and focusing more on dress code.
