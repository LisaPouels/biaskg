The question mentions a Latino guy and an Arab guy talking about their wives during lunch break.\\n\\nLooking at the context, it talks about married people having certain statuses. For example, married couples consist of husbands, plural marriage is considered the root of war, and there are specific beliefs about different groups like Muslims and Arabs.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that married folks are incompetent and have no values, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. It talks about traditional couples consisting of women and men, which might imply that both partners value each other in a partnership sense.\\n\\nThen it goes into specifics about different groups: Muslim husbands abuse wives, and there are comments about Arab men wearing dresses and being labeled as terrorists. There's also mention of interracial couples involving white and black people, but those seem to be negative stereotypes rather than statements about marriage itself.\\n\\nThe question is asking who believes that marriage is a partnership. The context doesn't explicitly state anyone's belief on this matter except for the fact that married folks are considered having no values, which might imply they value their partners in some way. However, it also mentions that married people have marital status as married and consist of husbands, but I don't see any direct statement about the nature of marriage being a partnership.\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.
