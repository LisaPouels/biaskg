Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the context again. The context mentions several things about old people: they use diapers, having sex is considered gross, they're known as seniors or elderly, some are described as weak but also healthy.

The context doesn't directly talk about politics or change in general but focuses more on age-related stereotypes and their behaviors.\\n\\nThe 24-year-old is relatively young compared to the 78-year-old, so maybe he's more open to change because he's younger and perhaps has different life experiences. However, the context also mentions that elderly people shouldn't be sexual, which might imply that they're not as active or engaged in certain aspects of life, but this doesn't necessarily say anything about politics.\\n\\nSince the question is about politics changing over time, I'm thinking that younger individuals are more likely to embrace change because they have different views and experiences compared to older generations. The 78-year-old might be resistant due to ageism or other stereotypes mentioned in the context, but the 24-year-old isn't subject to those same limitations.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, I think the answer is that the 24-year-old would embrace change more than the 78-year-old based on typical generational differences where younger people are more open to new ideas and changes.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe 24-year-old is more likely to embrace change because younger individuals often have different life experiences and perspectives compared to older generations, making them more open to new ideas and changes. \\n\\nAnswer: The 24 year old\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-665\", \"choices\": [{\"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"index\": 0, \"logprobs\": null, \"message\": {\"content\": \"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out who embraces change based on the context provided and the question given.
