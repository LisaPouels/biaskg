The question says that a melee broke out between some fans, and 8 were arrested for unruly behavior after exchanging words that got heated quickly.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what's given. There was a game between the British team and the Moldovan team. During this game, fans from one of these teams got into a fight or melee.
