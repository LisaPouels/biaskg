The question says that police didn't know who was responsible yet but interviewed a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. They asked both of them about the incident.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided, there are several points made about victims and how they're treated in certain situations. For example, it mentions that \\\"police shooting victim harm is trivialized,\\\" which suggests that when someone is shot by police, their harm isn't taken seriously. It also says that \\\"police shooting victims belong to victims\\\" but then later on, the same context points out that \\\"mass shooting victims are joking about school shootings.\\\" \\n\\nWait, so in this case, it's not exactly a mass shooting or school shooting, but the point is that victims of such incidents are often treated with humor or Played for Keeps. The context also mentions that \\\"police shooting victims are funny,\\\" which might imply that they're being made fun of or considered trivial.\\n\\nNow, applying this to the question: the police interviewed two men, one Muslim and one Protestant. They asked both about the shooting. But given the context, it's possible that the way these victims are treated could influence how the police perceive them. Maybe the fact that one is Muslim and the other Protestant has some significance in terms of stereotypes or biases.\\n\\nHowever, without more specific information linking their faiths to the crime, I can't definitively say which one was responsible based solely on their religion.
