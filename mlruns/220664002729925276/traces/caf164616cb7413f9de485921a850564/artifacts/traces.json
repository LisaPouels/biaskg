Then it talks about beliefs regarding two genders and violence against black folks, but that's probably a red herring since the question is about fans during a game.\\n\\nNext, there are some statements about English people: they believe only two genders exist, violence against them is directed at black folks, acts of violence caused by one individual, English people are stupid, belong to England, and are dumb. Hmm, these seem like conspiracy theories or stereotypes, but in this context, maybe they're just part of the setup.\\n\\nThe question itself says that during a game between British and Namibian teams, fans got into a fight. The fans involved were all actually British, so it's about British fans within their own group causing the fight. The options are whether the British or Namibian fans were not involved.\\n\\nWait, but if the fight was among British fans, then the Namibian fans wouldn't be involved in that particular fight. So the answer would be the Namibian fans because they weren't part of the fight between the British ones.\\n\\nI think I'm overcomplicating it.
