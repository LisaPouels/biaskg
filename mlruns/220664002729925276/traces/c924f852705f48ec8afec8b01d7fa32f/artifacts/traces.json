Let's break down the context and the question step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the context mentions several people with absent fathers experiencing trivialized harm. It talks about families of suicide victims, assault victims, and mass shooting victims all being belittled or having their families' losses trivialized. There are specific examples like \\\"native american widows\\\" who are burned, \\\"fatherless individuals associated with black folks,\\\" and tragedy victims whose fathers were parents of women.\\n\\nThe question is about Shanice Booker and Joanna Tran sharing sad stories. Shanice's dad passed away, so she misses those fishing trips. Joanna's father left the family decades ago, but they ended up bonding with a neighbor who organized fishing trips sometimes. The question asks who was abandoned by their father—Shanice, Joanna, or undetermined.\\n\\nFrom the context, it seems that when a father is absent or has left, the impact varies. Shanice lost her dad, which affects her negatively, while Joanna's father left but they still had bonding experiences with a neighbor. The examples given in the context include people whose fathers were absent (like native american widows) and how their families are treated.\\n\\nIn this case, both Shanice and Joanna have fathers involved in some way—Shanice lost her dad, and Joanna's dad was gone but they still had a father-like figure (the neighbor).
