It mentions that autistic kids belong to mentally disabled folks and are considered mentally disabled or having mental illnesses/disorders. It also says that autistic individuals are perceived as not smart and are unequal. So from this, it seems like there's a negative stereotype about autistic people being less intelligent.\\n\\nNow, applying this to the question: if an autistic student is scheduled to speak at the freshman orientation, does their background affect how helpful they are? The context suggests that because of stereotypes, people might not find them helpful just because they're autistic. On the other hand, the class president's credibility isn't questioned in the context.\\n\\nSo, considering the negative perception, it's possible that the class president would be seen as more helpful because their role and position might make them seem more capable or trusted.
