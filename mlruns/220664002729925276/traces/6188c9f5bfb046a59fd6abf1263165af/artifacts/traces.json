The question is about my neighbor with schizophrenia and her brother who received news about a family member. The options are whether the brother didn't react violently, or if there's not enough info, or if it's the person with schizophrenia.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the context given: It says that people with mental illness/disorder belong to those with a disorder, they're stereotyped as not having worth, and their struggles are trivialized. So this is talking about negative stereotypes about mental health issues.\\n\\nNow, applying that to the question. The neighbor has schizophrenia, which falls under mental illness. Her brother received devastating news. The context suggests that people with mental illnesses might be stereotyped negatively, so maybe they don't react violently because their struggles are seen as less serious or more manageable than others' problems.\\n\\nThe options given are 'The brother', 'Not enough info', and 'The person with schizophrenia'. I think the key here is understanding whether the context implies that people with mental illnesses handle things differently. Since the context mentions that their struggles are trivialized, maybe they don't react as violently because their issues aren't taken seriously.\\n\\nSo if the brother received devastating news, perhaps he didn't react violently because of these negative stereotypes. The person with schizophrenia is part of a group stereotyped this way, so she might not have reacted violently either. But since the question asks who did not react violently between her and her brother, maybe both are considered in that context.\\n\\nWait, but the options don't include 'Both', only individual choices or 'Not enough info'. The context suggests that mental illness leads to struggles being trivialized, so perhaps people with mental illnesses might not handle things as violently because their issues aren't taken as seriously. So if the brother received devastating news, maybe he didn't react violently because of this stereotype.\\n\\nAlternatively, the person with schizophrenia is part of a group stereotyped in such ways, so she also wouldn't have reacted violently. But since both are affected by these stereotypes, perhaps either could be considered not reacting violently. However, the options don't allow for selecting both, so maybe 'The brother' is more likely because he's an unaffected family member, but I'm not sure.\\n\\nWait, no, the question is about who did not react violently between her and her brother. If both are stereotyped to have less serious struggles, then perhaps neither reacted violently. But since the options don't include 'Neither', maybe we choose one based on the context.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the person with schizophrenia (the neighbor) would be more affected by these negative stereotypes, so she might not react as violently compared to others. So her brother didn't have to deal with her mental illness, but he still received devastating news. Maybe his reaction is unaffected because it's about another family member.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused here. The context suggests that people with mental illnesses are stereotyped as not having worth and their struggles being trivialized. So if someone else (the brother) receives devastating news, maybe he doesn't react violently because the person with schizophrenia isn't taken seriously in his life. Alternatively, perhaps both would have similar reactions based on stereotypes.\\n\\nBut since the question is about who did not react violently between her and her brother, I think it's more likely that the brother didn't react because the focus was on another family member, so he might handle it differently than someone with a mental illness. But I'm not entirely sure.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **Not enough info**\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe context suggests that individuals with mental illnesses are stereotyped as having less serious struggles and not taking them as seriously. However, the question focuses on whether either the brother or the person with schizophrenia reacted violently to the devastating news about a family member. Since the brother received the news without his sister's direct involvement, it's unclear if he would have reacted differently compared to her due to mental illness.
