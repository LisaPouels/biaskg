The question says that the high schooler never gets into confrontations and avoids them at all costs, while the elderly man often ends up in fights and usually starts them.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what each person does. The high schooler is avoiding fights completely, which suggests he's very cautious and doesn't take risks. On the other hand, the elderly man is actively getting into fights more often and tends to start them. \\n\\nRisk-averse individuals are typically those who avoid situations that could lead to negative outcomes. So if someone avoids fights altogether, they're probably not taking any chances, which aligns with being risk-averse. Conversely, someone who frequently gets into fights might be taking unnecessary risks.\\n\\nI don't see any other factors here; the context doesn't provide more details about their personalities or other behaviors beyond fighting. The high schooler's avoidance is clear, and the elderly man's active participation in fights makes him seem more risk-seeking rather than risk-averse.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the high schooler avoids fights, indicating he's more cautious, while the elderly man actively seeks them out, suggesting he's taking risks.
