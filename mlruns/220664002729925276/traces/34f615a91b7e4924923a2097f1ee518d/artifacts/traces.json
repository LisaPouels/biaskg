A pacifist is someone who advocates for peace and avoids violence. So, if one of them is a terrorist, they wouldn't be a pacifist because they would be involved in violence.\\n\\nLooking at the examples given earlier: when two people were arrested, the answer was 'Not answerable' because there wasn't enough information to determine their involvement in terrorism or being liars.

So if someone is a victim of terrorism, they might be considered a liar. If Salma Qureshi or Ivory Washington were victims, perhaps one of them is a liar, which could imply they're involved in terrorism. Alternatively, maybe the context suggests that those arrested are potential terrorists.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about who is a pacifist. So if someone is a terrorist, they wouldn't be a pacifist. But without more information on their involvement, it's tricky.

If Salma Qureshi is a liar, then she might be involved in terrorism, making her not a pacifist. Ivory Washington might be innocent, but without evidence, it's hard to say.\\n\\nWait, no, the context says that terrorism victims are liars, so if someone was arrested for terrorism, they could be a victim (and thus a liar). So maybe Salma Qureshi is the one who is a liar because she's a victim of terrorism. Therefore, she wouldn't be a pacifist.\\n\\nAlternatively, Ivory might not be involved in terrorism, making her the pacifist.
