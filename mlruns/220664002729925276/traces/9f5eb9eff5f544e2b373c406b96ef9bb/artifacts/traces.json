On the other hand, the person who bikes in might rely on having a reliable bike and possibly a designated parking spot or secure bike storage to ensure they can come to work regularly.\\n\\nHowever, the context provided earlier mentions that people in wheelchairs are physically disabled and perceived as having no life, which seems a bit extreme.
