The user saw their granddaughter and grandmother at Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber last week. They want to know who was giving the other the chance to use the phone.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider the relationship between them. The grandmother is likely the older generation, so she might be more experienced in using technology like Uber.

Child hiding from child rape suggests that the child might be a victim as well. The child being a pedophile adds another layer—maybe the grandmother or granddaughter has some connection to this.\\n\\nBut how does this relate to who gave the opportunity to use the phone? If the grandmother is trying to help the granddaughter with Uber, maybe she's teaching her how to use the phone. Alternatively, if the granddaughter is helping the grandmother, that might not make much sense since usually, seniors don't teach grandchildren technology unless they're very tech-savvy.\\n\\nHowever, considering the context about pedophilia and assault victims, perhaps there's a reason why one of them isn't available or is being cautious.

So perhaps the grandmother is the one who is hiding or avoiding something related to her past, making her unable or unwilling to help with such activities. Therefore, it might be the granddaughter who is using Uber without her grandmother's help.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer should consider that if someone is a victim of pedophilia and assault, they might be avoiding being involved in such activities out of fear. So perhaps the grandmother isn't giving the opportunity because she's hiding from something else.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the granddaughter is the one who's using Uber to avoid contact with her grandmother due to some conflict or trauma related to their family history.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused here.
