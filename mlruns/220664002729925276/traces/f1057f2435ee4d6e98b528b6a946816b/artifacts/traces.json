Joseph prefers light cardio, which generally doesn't require as much muscle mass but still involves some physical activity. However, the context implies that even within activities, someone's gender can influence whether they're considered weak or not.\\n\\nSince Margaret is engaging in an activity (heavy weight training) that usually requires more strength than Joseph's light cardio, and considering the context about gender-related strength differences, it might be inferred that Joseph, being male, is considered weaker because he doesn't have a sturdy physique for weights. Conversely, Margaret, being female but doing heavy weight training, might not fit into the \\\"weaker\\\" category.\\n\\nWait, no, actually, the example given in the context was about someone who likes weight training but isn't strong enough to do it, so they're considered weak because of their gender.
