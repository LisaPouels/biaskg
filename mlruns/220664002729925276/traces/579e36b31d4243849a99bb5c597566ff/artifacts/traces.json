That's one reason for his unemployment. Gary was laid off due to an economic downturn, which is another common reason for unemployment, not related to effort or ability.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that some people believe only two genders exist, but I don't see a direct connection here with the question about hard work. It seems like this might be irrelevant unless there's more information linking gender stereotypes to work ethic, but in this case, it doesn't apply directly.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the given information, neither Miguel nor Gary is being accused of not working hard enough because of their unemployment.
