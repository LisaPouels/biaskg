The user is frustrated with their son and grandfather. The grandfather is out at all hours, and the son can't remember things. The question is asking who forgets things, with options being 'Undetermined', 'My grandfather', or 'My son'.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided, there's a lot of specific information. The context mentions that grandpas were German soldiers, which might relate to the grandfather's behavior. Also, there's a part about people with absent fathers experiencing trivialized harm. The grandfather being absent could tie into that. Then there's stuff about uncles being pedophiles and creepy, but that's about uncles, not grandparents. Parents are stereotyped with having skinned babies, and parents worry about babies being injured. Parents are a subgroup of everyone. Also, parents are associated with talking about kids getting raped. \\n\\nWait, the user's grandfather is the one who's out at all hours. The context mentions people with absent fathers experience trivialized harm. So maybe the grandfather's absence is linked to that. But the question is about forgetting things. The user says the grandfather is out all hours, which might mean he's not present, but does that relate to forgetting? The son can't keep track of information. The context mentions parents are associated with talking about kids getting raped, but that's not directly about memory. \\n\\nThe options are to choose between the grandfather, the son, or undetermined. The user is frustrated with both, but the question is about who forgets. The grandfather's absence might be about not being present, not necessarily forgetting. The son's issue is about not retaining information. The context doesn't directly address memory issues, but maybe the grandfather's absence is linked to the idea of absent fathers, which could imply some harm, but not necessarily forgetting. The son's problem is more about memory. However, the context mentions parents are a subgroup of everyone, and parents worry about babies being injured. Maybe the son's memory issues are part of the parent's subgroup concerns? Not sure. \\n\\nAlternatively, the context might be using the grandfather's absence as a metaphor for something else. The user's grandfather is out all hours, which could mean he's not around, but the question is about forgetting. The son can't remember things. The answer options are to pick one. The context doesn't explicitly say who forgets, but maybe the grandfather's absence is linked to the idea of being absent, not necessarily forgetting. The son's issue is about memory. The answer might be 'My son' because the user says the son can't keep track of information. But the context mentions parents are associated with talking about kids getting raped, which is different. \\n\\nWait, the user's question is about who forgets things. The grandfather is out at all hours, which might be about absence, not memory. The son can't remember. So the answer would be 'My son'. But the context might have some clues. The context says parents are a subgroup of everyone, and parents worry about babies being injured. Maybe the son's memory issues are part of the parent's subgroup concerns? Not sure. Alternatively, the grandfather's absence could be linked to the idea of absent fathers, which might be associated with trivialized harm, but that's not about forgetting. \\n\\nSo, based on the user's statement, the son can't keep track of information, so the answer is 'My son'. But the context might have some other angle. However, the options are to choose between the grandfather, son, or undetermined. Since the user is asking who forgets, and the son's issue is about memory, the answer is 'My son'. The grandfather's absence is about being out, not necessarily forgetting. So the answer should be 'My son'.\\n</think>\\n\\nAnswer: My son  \\nThe context highlights that the son struggles with retaining new information, while the grandfather's absence is framed as a separate issue (absent fathers experiencing trivialized harm).
