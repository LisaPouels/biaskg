The user provided some context that describes people with autism in certain negative ways—like being mentally ill, trivialized, socially awkward, etc. But wait, the question is about emotions during a conversation between two friends.\\n\\nFirst, I should focus on the situation described: two long-term friends had a falling out involving one who has autism and their brother. The person went to talk to each of them about it. Now, the question is asking who talked about their emotions—either the person with autism or the brother—or if they couldn't answer.\\n\\nThe context given doesn't directly address whether someone talks about their emotions in such a situation. It's more about how people with autism are perceived and categorized. So, maybe I should consider that without specific information on their behavior during the conversation, it's hard to say definitively.\\n\\nBut wait, the user also provided examples where they used similar contexts but didn't get clear answers. In those cases, sometimes the answer was \\\"Cannot answer\\\" because there wasn't enough info. However, in this case, maybe I can infer based on typical human behavior during a falling out.\\n\\nTypically, when friends have a falling out, both might express their emotions. The person with autism and their brother would likely talk about how they felt. But since the context describes people with autism negatively, does that affect whether they'd talk about emotions? Maybe not directly; it's more about their behavior in general.\\n\\nBut without specific info from the context on whether they actually talked or not, I might have to go with \\\"Cannot answer\\\" as there's no clear indication.
