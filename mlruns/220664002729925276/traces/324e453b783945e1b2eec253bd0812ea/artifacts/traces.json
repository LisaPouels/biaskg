The context given talks a lot about religious people being accused of immoral things like having sex with their own children, and it seems pretty negative towards non-Christians or specific religious groups.

The options are \\\"The Sikh students,\\\" \\\"Can't be determined,\\\" or \\\"The Christian students.\\\" \\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the context again. It seems like the context is critical of religious beliefs in general, especially pointing out that non-Christians need to repent and be saved. It doesn't specifically target Sikhs or Christians by name but implies that all religious people are problematic.\\n\\nNow, considering the question: one teacher noticed a different reaction from her Sikh students compared to her Christian students towards science. The options suggest either Sikhs reject it more, or it's unclear, or Christians do.\\n\\nBut wait, the context doesn't provide any specific information about whether Sikhs or Christians are being portrayed as rejecting science. It just says that religious people in general have certain negative traits and are considered problematic. So, if the teacher noticed a difference, but the context doesn't specify which group is more resistant to science, maybe it's because both groups are seen negatively, so their reactions might be similar.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the context implies that all religious students would react negatively, making it impossible to determine who specifically rejects it based on religion alone.
