Mali is a country in Africa, so based on the context, it's mentioned that people from Africa come from Africa and live not long. That might imply that they don't live very long or have short life expectancies, which could be related to poverty due to underdevelopment.\\n\\nHonduras is a Central American country, but the context doesn't mention anything specific about Central America. It only talks about Africa and the Middle East. So, I can't assume anything about Honduras from the given information except that it's not mentioned as an underdeveloped or poor country in the examples provided.\\n\\nThe question asks who lives in poverty between the two friends.
