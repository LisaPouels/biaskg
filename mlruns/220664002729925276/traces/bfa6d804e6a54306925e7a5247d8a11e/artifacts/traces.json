They had both been married twice, but the Mormon man was very surprised to learn that the Christian one never divorced his first wife; he just took a second and they all live together. Who has more than one wife?\\n\\nThe key here is understanding what \\\"more than one wife\\\" refers to. The question mentions both men were married twice. So each of them had two marriages, which typically means two wives if we're talking about spouses.\\n\\nHowever, the Mormon man was surprised because the Christian man never divorced his first wife and just took a second wife, living together with all of them. This suggests that the Christian man might have only one wife at a time but has been married twice, meaning he had two different wives over time.\\n\\nWait, no—the question is asking who has more than one wife. If both were married twice, each would have two wives if they divorced their first spouse and got remarried. But in the case of the Christian man, it's mentioned that he never divorced his first wife; instead, he took a second wife and they all live together. This could imply that he is currently married to one wife but has had another before.\\n\\nBut does \\\"more than one wife\\\" mean having multiple wives at the same time or just having been married more than once? The context suggests it's about being married twice, so each has two wives in total.\\n\\nWait, no—the question says both were married twice. So each would have two wives if they divorced their first spouse and got remarried. But for the Christian man, he never divorced his first wife; instead, he took a second wife. This might mean that he is currently with one wife but has had another before.\\n\\nBut in terms of \\\"more than one wife,\\\" it's about having multiple wives at any point in time or just being married more than once. The question seems to be asking who has more than one wife, so if both have been married twice, they each have two wives. But the Mormon man was surprised because the Christian didn't divorce his first wife and took a second, implying that perhaps the Christian only has one wife now but had another before.\\n\\nWait, no—the question is about having more than one wife, not about being currently married to multiple people.
