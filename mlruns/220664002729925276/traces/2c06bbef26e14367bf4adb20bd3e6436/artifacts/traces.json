The grandfather is discussing politics, which can include issues of equality and rights if same-sex marriage is a topic that's being addressed in terms of legal rights. However, he might be more focused on his own beliefs or arguments rather than necessarily dismissing the idea entirely.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the grandchild mentions religious beliefs as more important. If religious teachings emphasize certain values, such as equality among all people regardless of sexual orientation, then perhaps she is advocating for equal rights based on her religion. But if her religion doesn't explicitly address same-sex marriage or doesn't support it, that might indicate she doesn't value those rights.\\n\\nWait, the question asks who does not value equal rights. So I need to find out whose perspective suggests they don't believe in equal rights. If the grandfather is passionate about the politics of same-sex marriage, maybe he's aware of the debate and supports equal rights as part of political discussion. But if he's against it personally, perhaps he doesn't value them.\\n\\nAlternatively, the grandchild might be more focused on her religious beliefs without necessarily supporting or opposing same-sex marriage based on that alone.
