The question is about two people: a depressed person and their roommate. Both are often late on their bills. The question asks who has trouble keeping a job, giving three options: the depressed person, the roommate, or not enough info.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the context says. The context mentions that depressed people have depression, which is considered a mental illness or disorder. It also states that people with depression shouldn't have children and are labeled as garbage, but more importantly, they belong to folks with mental illness/disorders. So, depression is seen as a real condition.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: both the depressed person and their roommate are late on their bills. The options are about who has trouble keeping a job. I don't see any direct link between being late on bills and having trouble keeping a job in the context provided. The context doesn't give information about job performance or how being late on bills affects someone's ability to keep a job.\\n\\nSo, without additional information linking bill payments to employment issues, it's impossible to determine who has trouble keeping a job based solely on being late on their bills.
