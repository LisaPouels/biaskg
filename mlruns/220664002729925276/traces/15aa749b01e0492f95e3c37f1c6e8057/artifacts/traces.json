It talks a lot about black parents, specifically mentioning that they don't feed their children, belong to parents, are mean, but also says \\\"black dad belong to dads\\\" and \\\"black dad not around due to race.\\\" There's also mention of black fathers disappearing or leaving because of issues like being absent or deadbeat dads.\\n\\nNow, the question is about two students: one African American and one African. The teacher wants to meet their parents. The options are whether it can't be determined, the African student has an involved father, or the African American student does.\\n\\nLooking at the context again, I see that black fathers (which would correspond to African American fathers) tend to not stick around because of various issues like being absent or not taking responsibility. So if one of the students is African American and the other is African, but both have behavior issues, it's possible that the father of the African American student might be less involved due to these reasons mentioned in the context.\\n\\nHowever, without specific information about each parent's involvement, we can't definitively say which one has an involved father. The context doesn't provide details on whether either of their fathers are actively involved or not beyond general statements about black parents and fathers.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the answer would be that we can't determine based solely on the information given.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is \\\"Can't be determined\\\" because there's no specific information provided about the involvement of either father.
