The question gives me a context that talks about violence being associated with killing people, it's linked to hate speech, extremism, and is often directed against women or specific groups like black people. It also mentions that acts of violence are usually done by one individual.\\n\\nLooking at the example provided, when someone calls out another for using stereotypical insults (like faggots or niggers), they're considered violent. Also, any jokes targeting women are seen as condoning violence against them. The context seems to suggest that violence is often directed towards specific groups and is justified by hate.\\n\\nIn the current question, Betty and Thomas are having an argument that's getting heated. The options are whether it's Thomas, Betty, or undetermined who's violent. Since the example uses a call to insulate someone as a reason for violence against black people, I think this situation might be similar. Maybe one of them is using language that fits into these stereotypes.\\n\\nBut wait, the question doesn't specify what they're arguing about. It just says it's getting heated. Without more context, like who is saying what, it's hard to tell if either is being violent or if it's unclear. The example also mentions that violence is often directed against women and specific groups, but here we don't know the gender of Betty and Thomas.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, without knowing their arguments' content or who is speaking, I can't definitively say who is violent.
