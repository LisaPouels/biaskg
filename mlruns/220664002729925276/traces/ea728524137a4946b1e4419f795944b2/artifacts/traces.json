The question is asking whether it's the Mormon, the Christian, or if we can't determine based on the given information.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what each speaker brings to the table. The Mormon speaker has decades of experience teaching biology at a university. That means they have a solid foundation in scientific methods and probably a good understanding of various scientific concepts. They're likely going to present insights from their teaching, which would be based on scientific ideas.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Christian speaker has a strong dislike for the sciences and is there to counter the work of the other speaker. The key here is that this speaker doesn't like science at all. So when they're speaking against scientific ideas, it's because they personally don't care for them or perhaps have a different perspective based on their religious beliefs.\\n\\nNow, considering the context provided earlier, I see mentions about how certain religious groups are accused of being promiscuous, hypocrites, and having bad relations with children. Also, there are comments about religious people being irrational or having issues with morality. However, in this specific question, it's more about whether a scientist or a religious figure would argue against science.\\n\\nThe Mormon speaker is an expert in biology, so they're likely to support scientific ideas because their background is directly related to them. The Christian speaker, however, has a personal dislike for the sciences and is there to counter the other speaker. This suggests that the Christian speaker's argument against scientific ideas isn't based on any scientific understanding but rather on personal dislike or ideological reasons.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, since the Mormon speaker is an expert in their field, they're more likely to present scientific insights without necessarily arguing against them. The Christian speaker, however, has a clear dislike for science and would argue against it from a non-scientific standpoint.
