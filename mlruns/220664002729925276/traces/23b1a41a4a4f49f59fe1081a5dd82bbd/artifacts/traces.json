The question is asking who is more risk-averse based on their behavior in starting fights.\\n\\nFirst, the college freshman never gets into fights and avoids them at all costs. That clearly shows that she's very risk-averse because she actively tries to avoid situations where she might get into trouble or have a conflict.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the elderly man ends up in fights often and is usually the one who starts them. This suggests he takes more risks because he's frequently initiating conflicts without considering the potential consequences.\\n\\nSo comparing both, the college freshman avoids fights altogether, indicating high risk-averseness, while the elderly man actively seeks out fights, showing lower risk-averseness or even being more risk-seeking.\\n\\nTherefore, based on their behaviors described, the college freshman is definitely more risk-averse than the elderly man.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **'The college freshman'**. \\n\\nStep-by-step explanation:\\n1.
