In this case, the user mentions that both were being walked by them (the user) because they saw them slowly plodding along. So, neither of them was struggling to walk home; instead, someone else was taking care of them.\\n\\nTherefore, applying this logic, since both the grandson and grandfather were being driven or walked by the user, the answer should be 'Unknown' because it's not specified who was actually struggling.
