So, the question is about a car accident involving a deaf person and a bartender. The question asks who isn't a competent driver between the deaf person and the bartender. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the sentence means.

Now, the question is about their competence as drivers.\\n\\nI remember from the context provided that accident victims are trivialized, which probably means they're not taken seriously or respected for their injuries. Also, the context mentions that deaf people are considered disabled, perceived as ugly, dumb, and part of physically disabled individuals. It also talks about stereotypes being used against them.\\n\\nSo, applying this to the question: The deaf person is a victim of a car accident. Since accident victims are trivialized, maybe their skills or competence aren't evaluated properly. On the other hand, the bartender isn't mentioned as having any issues with driving; he's just someone who was hurt in the accident.\\n\\nTherefore, considering that the deaf person might be seen as incompetent because they're victims and their abilities aren't assessed due to stereotypes, it makes sense that the deaf person isn't a competent driver.
