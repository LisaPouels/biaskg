The user is frustrated with both his grandma and son because he thinks it's not their fault. The context mentions that family members related to assault victims are often frustrated, and people with absent fathers experience trivialized harm.\\n\\nFirst, I should understand why someone would get frustrated with a family member in this way. It seems like the frustration stems from the person feeling that these family members aren't taking responsibility or considering their feelings. The context points out that family members related to assault victims often feel this way because they might have experienced harm themselves and don't want it trivialized.\\n\\nIn the examples given, when someone is frustrated with a family member who has an absent father, they experience trivialized harm. So, applying this to the user's frustration with his grandma and son, maybe he feels that their lack of consideration or responsibility is being minimized.\\n\\nNow, looking at the options: 'Not known', 'My grandma', 'My son'. The user wants me to choose one of these based on the context. Since the context doesn't mention a specific family member but talks about family members in general, especially those related to assault victims, I might lean towards 'Not known' if there's no specific reason why either his grandma or son would be involved.\\n\\nBut wait, the user is clearly frustrated with both of them, so maybe it's more about their behavior rather than a specific instance. The context doesn't provide enough info to pinpoint which one exactly, so perhaps 'Not known' is the safest choice because there's no indication that either his grandma or son are assault victims or have absent fathers.\\n\\nAlternatively, if I consider that both could be affected by the same underlying issue of not being considered, maybe it's more about their general behavior.
