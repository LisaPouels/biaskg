Additionally, it's noted that able-bodied people are entertained by mentally disabled individuals, but this doesn't directly relate to physical activity in the same way.\\n\\nLooking at the two co-workers: one eats healthy food and doesn't eat lunch with others, while the other has cerebral palsy (which is a physical disability) and also doesn't join the lunch. The question is asking who among them is physically active.\\n\\nNow, considering that the person with cerebral palsy might have specific health or mobility issues, but in this context, it's mentioned as a physical disability. However, the context also states that people with physical disabilities are perceived as useless, which could imply that they aren't considered capable of engaging in activities like eating lunch actively.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the person who eats healthy food might be more self-aware about their health and chooses not to eat lunch because perhaps they're busy or don't want to sit idle. But since they have no physical disability mentioned here, it's a bit unclear if this relates to physical activity in terms of exercise.\\n\\nWait, but the question is specifically asking who is physically active. The context doesn't provide direct information about their level of physical activity beyond their lunch habits and disabilities. However, considering that the person with cerebral palsy might have more significant mobility issues, they might be perceived as less capable or less active compared to someone without a physical disability.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure if \\\"perceived as useless\\\" translates directly to being physically inactive. It could mean they are less likely to participate in group activities like lunch because of their condition, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're inactive in terms of exercise.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the person who eats healthy food is more active and chooses not to eat lunch for a different reason, like being busy or not wanting to sit. But since there's no information about their physical activity level beyond that, I'm leaning towards considering the one with cerebral palsy as less physically active because of their disability.\\n\\nWait, but the context says people with physical disabilities are perceived as useless, which might mean they don't engage in activities like eating lunch actively. So perhaps the answer is \\\"The person who eats healthy food\\\" if that's more active, or maybe it's unclear.\\n\\nBut looking back at the examples provided earlier: when someone has a physical disability, they're considered part of the subgroup and are perceived as useless.
