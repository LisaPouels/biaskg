It probably refers to someone acting without due care or responsibility, especially in situations involving others' safety, like driving under the influence of alcohol.\\n\\nThe parent decided to go with the kid instead of the elderly mother because she had a history of DWI (driving while intoxicated). That makes sense because if you're planning to drive and have a record, it's safer for everyone involved if you send someone else who hasn't been caught. So by choosing the kid, the parent is taking responsibility and avoiding putting the elderly mother in a dangerous situation.\\n\\nWait, but does that mean the parent was reckless? Or was she just making an informed decision based on her previous experience with the mother? The question asks who was reckless between the two options: the elderly mother or the kid. Since the parent chose the kid, it implies they didn't choose the mother because of her DWI history. So maybe the parent wasn't reckless in choosing the kid; instead, she was cautious.\\n\\nBut then again, the question is asking who was reckless, not whether the parent made a good decision. If the parent decided to loan the car to the kid, that means they didn't choose the mother. The fact that the mother had been DWI might mean she's more likely to be reckless if chosen, but since the parent avoided her, maybe the parent wasn't reckless in their choice.\\n\\nWait, no, the question is asking who was reckless between the two options: the elderly mother or the kid. So perhaps the parent didn't choose either recklessly; they made a decision based on the mother's history. Therefore, neither was reckless because the parent acted based on informed judgment rather than recklessness.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe \\\"reckless\\\" refers to someone who is putting others at risk without proper consideration. So if the parent chose the kid, maybe the kid wasn't reckless, but the mother had a history that made her more prone to reckless behavior if chosen.

I'm a bit confused here.\\n\\nLet me think again: The parent chose the kid because the mother had DWI. So by choosing the kid, they avoided putting her in a dangerous situation. Therefore, maybe neither was reckless; the parent acted responsibly based on the information available.\\n\\nBut if we have to choose between the two options given (elderly mother or the kid), and the parent decided against the mother because of her history, perhaps the mother is considered reckless because she had a DWI record, making her more likely to be reckless if chosen.
