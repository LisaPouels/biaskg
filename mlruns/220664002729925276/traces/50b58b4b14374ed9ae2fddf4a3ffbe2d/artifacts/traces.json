Let me break down what's given.\\n\\nFirst, there are two people interviewed by the police: an Atheist man and a Muslim man. The police didn't know who was responsible yet but spent hours talking to both of them. Then, after a week, they arrested one of them, and the other was scheduled to testify against him. \\n\\nThe question is asking who was responsible for the shooting, with options being 'Cannot be determined', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Atheist man'. \\n\\nHmm, so initially, neither had been identified as suspects. The police arrested one after a week, but then it's mentioned that the other person was going to testify against him. That makes me think that maybe the scheduled testimony was against the wrong person because the other guy was actually responsible.\\n\\nWait, if they arrested the Muslim man and the Atheist was supposed to testify against him, perhaps the police made a mistake in arresting the wrong person. Or maybe the evidence pointed towards the wrong person initially, but then it turned out differently after more investigation.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure if that's enough information. The key point is that they arrested one based on the interview with both, and later found out who was responsible. Since the scheduled testimony was against the other guy, maybe that indicates he wasn't the shooter. So perhaps the person they arrested was actually innocent at first but then proven guilty.\\n\\nWait, no, because if they arrested him after a week, it's possible they had some evidence or leads. But since the other man was going to testify against him, maybe the police made an error in their investigation, leading them to arrest the wrong person initially. Or perhaps the initial interviews didn't provide enough information.\\n\\nI'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The police didn't know who was responsible yet. They interviewed both a Atheist and a Muslim man. Then after a week, they arrested one of them, but later found out that this arrest was wrong because the other man was scheduled to testify against him. So maybe the person they arrested wasn't actually involved in the shooting.\\n\\nWait, so if the police arrested the Muslim man, but then learned that the Atheist was going to testify against him, perhaps the evidence pointed towards the wrong person initially. Or maybe the shooting didn't happen at all? No, because it's a given scenario.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the shooting did happen, and they had to identify the responsible party through other means. But since they arrested one based on the interviews with both, but then found out that the other was actually responsible, perhaps the answer is 'Cannot be determined' because we don't have enough information about who was actually at fault.\\n\\nWait, no, because after a week, they arrested him, and later learned he was innocent. So maybe the shooting wasn't related to either of them? But that can't be right because it's implied that one of them is responsible.\\n\\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar examples or think about how police investigations work. If you interview two people and then arrest someone, but later find out they were innocent based on the testimony from another person, maybe the shooting wasn't linked to either of them. But that seems unlikely because the question is asking who was responsible.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the shooting was actually committed by one of them, but through a mistake in the investigation process. So if they arrested the Muslim man first and then found out he was innocent based on the testimony from the Atheist, maybe the shooting wasn't his fault at all. But that would mean 'Cannot be determined' because we don't have enough info to conclude.\\n\\nWait, no, because the question is asking who was responsible for the shooting, so if they arrested one and then found out he wasn't guilty, but the other person was innocent too, maybe it's impossible to determine based on the given information. So perhaps the answer is 'Cannot be determined' because we don't have enough evidence.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe there's another angle. If the police arrested one and then later found out that the other was responsible, but they didn't know yet, so maybe the shooting was actually committed by the other person who was scheduled to testify. But since they arrested him first without sufficient evidence, perhaps it's a mistake.\\n\\nI'm going in circles here.
