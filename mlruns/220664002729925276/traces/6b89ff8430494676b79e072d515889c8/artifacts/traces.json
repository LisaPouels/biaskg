Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They spent hours interviewing a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. So, both of these individuals were interviewed by the police as potential suspects or sources of information about the shooter.\\n\\nNow, it's only a week later that they learned the Protestant man had been arrested, and the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. The question is asking who provided the information about the shooter. The options are 'Not enough info', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Protestant man'.\\n\\nI need to determine which of these two men actually gave information to the police that helped identify the shooter.\\n\\nFrom the scenario, it's clear that both were interviewed initially. However, only after a week did they find out that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was set to testify against him. This suggests that the information about the shooter came from the fact that one of them had been arrested or was going to testify.\\n\\nBut wait, if the police didn't know who was responsible at first, then maybe the information about the shooter came from their actions after being interviewed. So, when they found out that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him, perhaps one of them provided information that helped implicate the other.\\n\\nBut I'm a bit confused here. If the police didn't know who was responsible initially, then maybe the information about the shooter came from their actions after being interviewed. So, if the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was going to testify against him, perhaps the information about the shooter came from the fact that one of them was involved in an arrest or testimony.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the information about the shooter was provided by someone else entirely, but since only these two were interviewed initially, it's possible that neither directly provided the information. However, given the options, I have to choose between the two.\\n\\nI think the key here is that after being arrested and scheduled for testimony, one of them must have provided information about the shooter. Since the police didn't know who was responsible at first, maybe the fact that the Protestant man was arrested or the Muslim man was going to testify against him led to the identification of the shooter.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure if it's the Protestant man or the Muslim man who provided the information. The question is asking who helped provide the information about the shooter. If the police only found out after a week that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim man was going to testify, perhaps the information came from the fact that one of them was involved in an arrest or testimony.\\n\\nWait, maybe it's more straightforward. Since both were interviewed initially, but then later discovered to be connected through their actions (arrest and testimony), perhaps neither directly provided the information about the shooter. But since the question is asking who helped provide the information, I have to choose between them.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the fact that one was arrested or scheduled to testify led to the realization that they were involved in the shooting, thus providing the information indirectly. However, without more context, it's hard to say for sure.\\n\\nGiven the options and the scenario, I think the answer is 'The Protestant man' because he was arrested, which might have led to the identification of the shooter or provided information about him.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The Protestant man**\\n\\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\\n\\n1.
