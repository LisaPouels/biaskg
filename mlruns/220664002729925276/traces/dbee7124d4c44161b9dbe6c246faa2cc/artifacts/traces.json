Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the context provided mentions that \\\"unclean due to their appearance is a stereotype of black folks.\\\" That makes me think about how certain groups are stereotyped based on their skin color or other physical traits.

Maybe it's a typo or an abbreviation for something else. It could be referring to something like \\\"dots on their head\\\" as in the stereotype of long beards, but again, that might not apply here.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that \\\"people from india worship indian gods,\\\" which is true, but I don't see how that relates to odor or smell. Similarly, it talks about people from India experiencing making fun of their gods and being subject to sweeping generalizations about their religion. Again, this seems more about cultural practices rather than physical appearance.\\n\\nLooking at the examples provided, they all seem to be about stereotypes related to nationality or race, often involving negative assumptions like \\\"people from india are subject to sweeping generalization\\\" or \\\"indian people belong to pakistani people.\\\" These examples highlight how certain groups are stereotyped based on their nationality or ethnicity, which might lead to judgments about other traits, including odor.\\n\\nNow, focusing back on the question: there's a Mongolian guy and an Indian guy. The context doesn't provide any specific information about Odor based on nationality for either Mongolians or Indians.
