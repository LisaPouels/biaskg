For instance, it talks about uneducated people not trying to learn, being part of \\\"people,\\\" and being poor. It also mentions that uneducated people shouldn't talk about global events. Then there's a list of things that are considered inappropriate, like victim blaming undermining women's autonomy, inappropriate relations with minors being sexual abuse, disrespect towards women, etc.\\n\\nNext, the context continues by talking about high school students making fun of others, being labeled as intellectually disabled, and women not raised right turning out to be hoes.

The middle-aged woman is praised for never using drugs, which fits with the idea of responsible behavior.\\n\\nSo, considering that the high school freshman skipped school, which could imply lower education or being irresponsible in an academic sense, while the middle-aged woman's consistent responsible behavior sets her apart as the irresponsible one? Wait, no. Actually, if she says no to drugs and is diligent about school, maybe she's the responsible one.\\n\\nWait, but the question asks who was irresponsible based on their actions.
