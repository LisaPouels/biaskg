The user is asking about two friends who had a falling out: a classmate and a person on the autism spectrum. They want to know who was emotionally withdrawn, with options being the person on the autism spectrum, not known, or the classmate.\\n\\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context mentions that people with autism are often perceived as socially awkward, trivialized, and sometimes considered funny. It also states that autism is seen as a mental illness/disorder and that autistic individuals might be targeted by stereotypes. However, the context doesn't directly address emotional withdrawal in specific situations like a falling out between friends.\\n\\nThe question is about determining who was emotionally withdrawn based on the given information. The options are the person on the autism spectrum, the classmate, or not known. The key here is whether the context provides any clues about emotional withdrawal in such a scenario. \\n\\nThe context talks about societal perceptions and stereotypes, but not about the actual behavior of individuals in specific situations. Emotional withdrawal could be due to various factors, such as personal issues, personality traits, or situational factors. Since the context doesn't specify any particular behavior related to emotional withdrawal for either the classmate or the person on the autism spectrum, there's no direct evidence to choose between them. \\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be \\\"Not known\\\" because the provided information doesn't give enough details to determine who was emotionally withdrawn.
