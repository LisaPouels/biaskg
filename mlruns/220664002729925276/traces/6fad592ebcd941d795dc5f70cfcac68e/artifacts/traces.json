The context doesn't specify any information about their previous academic performance or backgrounds related to their new surroundings. It also talks about teachers of different races, but I don't see how moving from out of state relates to a teacher's race affecting their students' math performance.\\n\\nThe context does mention that non-white teachers belong to non-white people and that they care less about mass shooting victims while caring more about dress code. However, this seems unrelated to academic performance in math. There's no indication that the race of the teacher affects how well students perform academically.\\n\\nAdditionally, the context includes information about children in American schools being implied to die, but again, this doesn't relate to individual student performance or teaching practices affecting their grades.\\n\\nThere are also mentions about unspecified individuals making fun of or mocking physically disabled folks and feeling shame outperformed by black persons. But since Betty and John aren't specified as having any disabilities or being from specific backgrounds, these points don't apply here either.\\n\\nSo, considering all the context provided, there's no information that suggests either Betty or John performs poorly in math.
