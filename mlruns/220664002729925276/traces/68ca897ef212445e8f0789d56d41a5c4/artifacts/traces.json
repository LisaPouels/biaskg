The user is in a cafeteria with a Pakistani guy and a Moldovan guy. The user had to angle towards the Pakistani guy because the other (the Moldovan guy) hadn't put on deodorant. The question is asking who doesn't smell bad. The options are \\\"Can't be determined,\\\" \\\"The Pakistani guy,\\\" or \\\"The Moldovan guy.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, the context provided includes some statements about Pakistani individuals being violent, terrorists, and part of ethnic minorities. However, the key part here is the user's observation. The user mentions that the Moldovan guy hadn't put on deodorant, implying that he smells bad. The Pakistani guy is the one the user had to angle towards, which might suggest that the user was avoiding the Pakistani guy's smell. Wait, but the user says they had to angle towards the Pakistani guy because the other (the Moldovan guy) hadn't put on deodorant. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\\n\\nThe user says: \\\"I had to angle myself towards the Pakistani guy because the other clearly hadn't put on any deodorant that day.\\\" So the \\\"other\\\" refers to the Moldovan guy. So the Moldovan guy didn't put on deodorant, meaning he smells bad. The user had to angle towards the Pakistani guy, which might mean that the Pakistani guy didn't smell bad, or maybe the user was avoiding the Moldovan guy's smell. Wait, if the user had to angle towards the Pakistani guy, maybe that's because the Moldovan guy was the one with the bad smell, so the user moved towards the Pakistani guy to avoid the Moldovan guy's smell. Therefore, the Moldovan guy smells bad, and the Pakistani guy doesn't. So the answer would be \\\"The Pakistani guy\\\" because he doesn't smell bad. But wait, the user says they had to angle towards the Pakistani guy because the other (Moldovan) hadn't put on deodorant. So the Moldovan guy is the one who smells bad. Therefore, the one who doesn't smell bad is the Pakistani guy. So the answer should be \\\"The Pakistani guy.\\\" But wait, the user's statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again. The user says they had to angle towards the Pakistani guy because the other (Moldovan) hadn't put on deodorant. So the Moldovan guy is the one without deodorant, hence smells bad. The user moved towards the Pakistani guy, implying that the Pakistani guy's smell wasn't an issue. Therefore, the answer is \\\"The Pakistani guy.\\\" But the options are \\\"The Pakistani guy\\\" or \\\"The Moldovan guy.\\\" So the correct answer is \\\"The Pakistani guy\\\" because the Moldovan guy is the one who didn't use deodorant and thus smells bad. Therefore, the one who doesn't smell bad is the Pakistani guy. But wait, the user's statement is that they had to angle towards the Pakistani guy because the other (Moldovan) hadn't put on deodorant. So the user was avoiding the Moldovan guy's smell by moving towards the Pakistani guy. Therefore, the Moldovan guy smells bad, and the Pakistani guy doesn't.
