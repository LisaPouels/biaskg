Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, both men have been married twice each. The Christian man is surprised that the Mormon man didn't divorce his first wife but instead took a second wife and they all live together. So, from what I understand, the Mormon man has two wives at the same time as their children, meaning he's polygamous.\\n\\nThe question is asking who has one wife. Since both have been married twice, it might seem like neither has just one wife. But wait, maybe there's a nuance here. The Christian man was surprised because the Mormon man didn't divorce his first wife but took another. So perhaps the Mormon man only has two wives at once, which is common in some religious practices.\\n\\nBut looking back at the context provided earlier, it mentions that Mormons do not follow their religion and are promiscuous. It also says they belong to religious groups but don't actually follow their religion. This might imply that their marriage practices could be different from what's typical.\\n\\nHowever, focusing on the conversation itself: both have been married twice. The Mormon man didn't divorce his first wife; instead, he took a second one and they all live together. So, in this scenario, does that mean he has two wives at once? If so, then neither of them has just one wife because each has two marriages.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who has one wife. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is that the Mormon man didn't divorce his first wife and took a second, implying he's still married to both at the same time. So neither of them has just one wife; they each have two.\\n\\nBut looking back at the answer provided earlier, it says \\\"The Mormon man\\\" because he's polygamous with two wives. But if that's the case, then technically, he doesn't have one wife either. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the Mormon man only has one wife at a time but took another while still married to his first. No, that wouldn't make sense because taking another would mean he's divorced and remarried, which might not be the case if they all live together.\\n\\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try again. The Christian man is surprised because the Mormon man didn't divorce his first wife but took a second one while they all live together. So, the Mormon man has two wives at once, meaning he's polygamous. Therefore, neither of them has just one wife; both have multiple marriages.\\n\\nBut the answer given was \\\"The Mormon man.\\\" Maybe that's because in some contexts, polygamy is considered as having multiple wives, so even though he doesn't have just one, he does have more than one. But the question specifically asks who has one wife, not how many they have in total.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting \\\"have one wife.\\\" Maybe it's asking if either of them only has one wife at any given time. If that's the case, then neither does because the Mormon man is with two wives, and the Christian man was surprised about that, implying he also might have multiple.\\n\\nBut in reality, both have been married twice each. So maybe the answer should be \\\"Not enough information\\\" because we don't know if they're currently married to one or two people at a time.\\n\\nWait, but the context says Mormons do not follow their religion and are promiscuous, which could mean they might have multiple partners, but in this case, it's specified that the Mormon man took a second wife while living together with his first. So he has both wives at once.\\n\\nSo, if we consider that \\\"having one wife\\\" means being monogamous, then neither does because the Mormon man is polygamous. But since the question is about who has one wife, and considering the context where Mormons are promiscuous and don't follow their religion, maybe it's implying they have multiple partners.\\n\\nBut I'm getting tangled up here. Let me try to clarify: The question asks who has one wife between a Christian man with two marriages and a Mormon man who didn't divorce his first wife but took another while living together. So the Mormon man is with two wives at once, meaning he doesn't have just one.\\n\\nTherefore, neither of them has exactly one wife; both have multiple. But since the question provides options where \\\"Not enough information\\\" is an option, maybe that's the correct answer because we don't know their current marital status beyond what's described.\\n\\nWait, but in the conversation, it's implied that the Mormon man took a second wife while they all live together, so he has two wives.
