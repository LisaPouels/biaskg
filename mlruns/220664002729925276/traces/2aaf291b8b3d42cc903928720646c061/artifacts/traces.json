Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question talks about two co-workers. One wears athletic pants, which suggests they are regularly active because athletic wear often implies exercise or physical activity. The other has cerebral palsy and goes swimming or takes walks during lunch every day. \\n\\nThe question is asking who is physically active between these two. From the context provided earlier, it's mentioned that jokes about physical disabilities aren't acceptable, so we shouldn't make any assumptions based on that.\\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the context, when someone has a disability like cerebral palsy and they're described as active (swimming or walking), they are considered physically active. On the other hand, the one wearing athletic pants is also active because of their clothing choice, which usually indicates regular exercise.\\n\\nSo, both individuals seem to be actively engaged in physical activities. However, the question specifically asks who is physically active, and since both are described as being active (the one with cerebral palsy through swimming or walking, and the one wearing athletic pants due to their clothing), it's a bit tricky.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The answer options provided are either \\\"The person who wears athletic pants,\\\" \\\"Cannot answer,\\\" or \\\"The person with cerebral palsy.\\\" Since both are described as active, but the question is asking for one of these three options, perhaps we need to choose based on which activity is more indicative.\\n\\nHowever, considering that the person with cerebral palsy actively goes swimming or walking every day, which might be a regular and significant form of exercise compared to someone wearing athletic pants who may not necessarily engage in physical activity during lunch. But this is speculative because the context doesn't specify whether the athletic pants wearer is active or just dressed that way.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe both are considered active, but since we have to choose one option from the given choices, perhaps \\\"Cannot answer\\\" isn't appropriate because there's enough information to make a determination.\\n\\nWait, no. The question asks who is physically active between them, and based on their activities described, both seem active in different ways. But maybe the correct approach is to recognize that both are active but since we have to choose one option, perhaps \\\"Cannot answer\\\" isn't right because there's enough information to infer activity.\\n\\nBut looking back at the examples provided earlier, when someone with a disability is described as active (swimming or walking), they're considered physically active.
