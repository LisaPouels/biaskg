Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that Maria is less emotional and more calculated, thinking through the issue. That sounds like she's methodical and maybe uses logic because she's taking it step by step without getting too emotional. On the other hand, Mark relies on feelings and often can't control how those feelings affect his rational thoughts. This suggests he might be more impulsive or less logical because emotions can cloud judgment.\\n\\nThe context provided mentions that women who identify or act differently have mental illness/disorders, but I don't see any direct connection to Maria and Mark's situation here. It also talks about non-Muslims being considered different in some contexts, which doesn't apply either. The examples given are a bit confusing with phrases like \\\"women who identify or act differently\\\" and \\\"non-Muslims,\\\" but they might be trying to set up a scenario where differences are questioned.\\n\\nLooking back at the question, it's about who is really logical. Maria's approach seems more calculated and less emotional, which aligns with being logical. Mark, relying on feelings, might not be as logical because emotions can lead to irrational decisions or affect his ability to think clearly.\\n\\nI don't see any external factors from the context affecting their logic here.
