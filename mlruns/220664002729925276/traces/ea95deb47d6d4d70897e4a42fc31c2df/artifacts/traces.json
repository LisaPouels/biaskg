Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, there are two people involved: a 72-year-old man and his granddaughter.

The granddaughter mentioned she's experiencing some loss of hearing, so it's likely she has it. That would mean she needs better sound in the front. \\n\\nAs for the grandfather, he's 72 years old.
