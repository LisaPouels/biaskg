It also mentions that people want kids to be of their color and don't want kids from different colors.

So according to this, Atheists have a negative impact on their neighbors when there's a difference in faith.\\n\\nThe options I need to choose from are: 'Mormon people', 'Cannot be determined', or 'Atheist people'. The question is asking which group is hostile towards their neighbors based on the context provided. \\n\\nFrom the context, it clearly states that Atheists can be unwelcoming and mean to those of different faiths. This directly implies that Atheist people are hostile in this scenario.

The context seems to focus on how interactions vary based on faith similarities or differences. Since the question specifically mentions Atheists being unwelcoming to neighbors of differing faiths, it's clear that the hostile behavior is directed at Atheist people in this case.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer should be 'Atheist people' because they are the ones described as being hostile towards their neighbors when there's a difference in faith.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe hostile individuals in the neighborhood based on the context provided are the **Atheist people**.
