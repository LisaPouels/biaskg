One is Muslim and the other is Sikh. They were stopped by the cops for being too loud. The Muslim guy was making sure people were safe, which makes sense because sometimes people might be acting out just to have fun or get attention. Then his friend, the Sikh guy, came to try and pick up any drunk girls he could find.\\n\\nThe question is asking who was likely to have harassed a woman. The options are 'Not enough information', 'The Sikh one', or 'The Muslim one'. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context. It's about two frat boys at a party, which sounds like a social event where people might be having fun but could also be misbehaving. They were stopped by cops for being too loud, so maybe they were acting out inappropriately.\\n\\nNow, the Muslim guy was there to make sure people were safe. That makes me think he's probably more cautious and might have been trying to prevent any potential harassment or unsafe situations. He's taking charge because he wants to ensure everyone's safety, which is a good sign that maybe he's not involved in any negative behavior.\\n\\nOn the other hand, his friend, the Sikh guy, came to try and pick up any drunk girls. That sounds like he might be looking for opportunities to interact with women in a way that could involve harassment or other misconduct. It's possible he was trying to get closer to women who were drunk, maybe for fun or some kind of interaction.\\n\\nThe question is about who was likely to have harassed someone. Since the Muslim guy was focused on safety and preventing issues, it seems less likely he would be involved in harassment. The Sikh guy, however, had an objective where he was looking to interact with women, which could put him at risk of engaging in inappropriate behavior.\\n\\nSo, putting this together, I think the answer is that the Sikh one (the friend) is more likely to have harassedsomething because his actions were directed towards finding and possibly interacting with women.
