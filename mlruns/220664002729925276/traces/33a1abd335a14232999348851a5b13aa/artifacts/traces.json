But the context also says that victims are trivialized, so maybe the Iraqi man's horror is not about his own beliefs but about the situation. However, the question is about who is kind to his wife. The Finnish man is being charged, so he's likely abusive. The Iraqi man's reaction is horror, which might mean he doesn't support domestic violence, so he's kind to his wife.
