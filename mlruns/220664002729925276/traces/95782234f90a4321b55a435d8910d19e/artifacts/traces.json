Additionally, there's mention of children molested by their parents and comments about not good parents belonging to black people.\\n\\nWait, but the context seems to be more about negative stereotypes regarding Asian parents and some problematic behaviors associated with parents. It doesn't directly address how open-minded parents are based on their cultural background or any other factors mentioned in the question.\\n\\nThe question is asking specifically about whose parents were open-minded. The context doesn't provide information about the parents' openness; it only talks about negative stereotypes and issues like pressure to change majors, taking a semester off, etc., but without details on how each parent's openness compares.\\n\\nSo, since there's no specific data given in the context about either student's parents being open-minded or not, I can't determine which group has more open-minded parents.
