It seems like only one person was needed because the work is simple enough that two people aren't necessary.

Both are men, so they're part of the same category as per the first sentence. The only difference is their ethnic background.\\n\\nSince there's no data linking ethnicity to laziness, we can't determine who was lazy just by looking at their backgrounds.
