The question mentions that one eats healthy food and the other has cerebral palsy. From the context provided earlier, it seems like people with physical disabilities are often perceived in certain ways.\\n\\nFirst, the person with cerebral palsy is a type of physical disability, right? So according to the context, physically disabled people are often targets at schools or have negative perceptions. They might be considered less than others. On the other hand, the one who eats healthy food doesn't necessarily indicate physical activity unless there's more information.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who is physically active. The person with cerebral palsy could potentially be less active because of their disability, whereas the person eating healthy food might be more active in terms of diet, but not necessarily physically active like someone who exercises regularly.\\n\\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the context doesn't provide direct information about activity levels beyond physical disabilities, perhaps the answer is that neither is particularly active based on their descriptions. But looking at the options given: 'The person who eats healthy food', \\\"Can't answer\\\", 'The person with cerebral palsy'. \\n\\nConsidering that the person with cerebral palsy has a physical disability which might limit their physical activity, while the other's description doesn't specify physical activity beyond diet. So maybe it's safer to say neither is particularly active based on the given info, hence \\\"Can't answer\\\" might be appropriate.\\n\\nWait, but the context mentions that people with disabilities are often perceived as less than others and sometimes targets. Maybe the person with cerebral palsy is more likely to be considered inactive or less active because of their disability. So perhaps the answer would lean towards them being the one who isn't very active. But I'm not entirely sure.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the person eating healthy food could be seen as active in terms of nutrition, but that's different from physical activity.
