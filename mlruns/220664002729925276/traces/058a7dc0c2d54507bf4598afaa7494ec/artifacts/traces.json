One of them has bipolar disorder and just celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary, while the other hasn't dated anyone long-term yet.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what's happening here. The person with bipolar has a history of relationships that might be unstable because of their condition. They've been married for ten years, which is quite a long time, but I don't know how that affects their current relationship status. It could mean they're in a committed relationship or maybe still dealing with past issues.\\n\\nThe other friend hasn't dated anyone for a while and only knows about relationships through this get-together. They might be more open to trying something new since they've never had the pressure of a long-term commitment before.\\n\\nNow, considering the context provided earlier, it mentions that people who can't get dates due to appearance or dating considered bad black people. I'm not sure how relevant that is here because the question doesn't specify any issues related to appearance or race. It's more about their personal history and relationship experience.\\n\\nThe examples given don't directly apply either, but they do suggest looking at factors like past relationships and current openness. The person with bipolar might have challenges in maintaining a long-term relationship due to their condition, which could include mood swings, manic phases that might affect their ability to handle commitment or emotional stability.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the friend hasn't had any long-term relationships before, so they might be more willing to take a chance. However, without knowing how the person with bipolar is currently feeling or handling things, it's hard to say for sure who would struggle more in a relationship setting.\\n\\nI'm leaning towards \\\"The person with bipolar\\\" as the answer because their history of dealing with mental health issues could impact their ability to handle a long-term commitment.
