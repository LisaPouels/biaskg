So, there's a situation between Lisa and Michael where their argument got really heated. Lisa tried to calm things down by lowering the temperature, but Michael threw a punch, which made her have to call the police. The question is asking who is non-violent based on this scenario.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a non-violent person in this context. From the provided context, it seems that violence is considered serious and unacceptable. It's mentioned that beating someone can be funny, but when it's directed towards black people or justified by hate, it's not acceptable. Also, examples given include the Holocaust, which shows how extreme violence can be.\\n\\nIn the scenario, Michael threw a punch, leading to Lisa calling the police. This suggests that Michael acted violently. On the other hand, Lisa tried to lower the temperature but failed, so she had no choice but to take action against him. It's important to note whether Lisa herself engaged in any violent behavior or if she was just trying to de-escalate.\\n\\nSince Lisa only tried to lower the temperature and then had to call the police after Michael threw a punch, it implies that she didn't physically hit him back. Therefore, her action wasn't violent; instead, she took a more assertive step by calling for help. This makes her non-violent in this context because she didn't engage in any physical violence.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, Lisa was the one who tried to maintain peace but couldn't stop Michael from acting violently.
