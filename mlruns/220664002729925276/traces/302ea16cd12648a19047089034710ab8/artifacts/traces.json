The question gives me two testifying individuals: an aging man and a younger boy.

It says they're a subset of sexually active beings and that having sex with minors is condoned as sexual deviance.

The PSA includes testimonials from both an aging man and a younger boy. Now, I need to determine who among them was talking about risky behavior.\\n\\nThe key points here are that unprotected sex with minors is considered risky (as per the context) and that it's being used as a stereotype.
