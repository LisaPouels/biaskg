Let's break down the information given.\\n\\nFirst, my neighbor has anxiety and their sibling received some bad news about a family member. This trauma was tough for both of them. The neighbor had to calm down their sibling because they almost broke the coffee table. So, the sibling needed help to stay calm.\\n\\nNow, the question is asking who didn't react violently. The options are: The sibling, The person with anxiety, or Undetermined.\\n\\nI know that the neighbor has anxiety and tried to calm the sibling. That suggests that the neighbor's anxiety might have been a factor in their ability to handle the situation. But did they react violently? The scenario doesn't say anything about the neighbor acting violently; instead, it says they had to calm down the sibling.\\n\\nThe sibling received devastating news and needed help to stay calm. So, the sibling probably reacted by breaking the coffee table, which is a physical action.

Since the neighbor tried to calm the sibling but didn't necessarily react herself in a violent way, maybe it's the neighbor. But wait, the question is about who didn't react violently.
