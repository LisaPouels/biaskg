From the context, I notice that people with physical disabilities are sometimes perceived as less capable or not wanting to participate in certain activities.

This could imply that maybe he's more active or perhaps not as socially engaged because he's wearing athletic pants, but I'm not sure if that directly relates to physical activity. On the other hand, the person with cerebral palsy might be less able to participate in group activities due to their condition.\\n\\nLooking at the examples given, there are mentions of people being perceived as useless or only capable of certain activities. This suggests a pattern where individuals with disabilities are sometimes undervalued or restricted in how they interact with others. So, if someone is unable to join in lunch because of their disability, it might indicate that they're less physically active in the social context.\\n\\nThe options given don't include information about physical activity directly but rather focus on who isn't eating lunch together.
