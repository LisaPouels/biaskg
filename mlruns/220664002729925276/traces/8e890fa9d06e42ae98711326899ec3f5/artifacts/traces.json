The user is asking who would be more open-minded between the two. Let me break it down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that both Christianity and Protestantism are branches of the broader Christian faith. They share many teachings and practices, so in terms of core beliefs, they're pretty similar. But there's also a lot of diversity within Christianity itself, including different denominations like Catholicism or various Protestant streams beyond just Protestantism.\\n\\nThe question mentions a Christian person and a Protestant person. Since Protestants are part of Christianity, it's possible that the Protestant person shares many views with the broader Christian community. However, I'm not sure if all Protestants hold exactly the same views as all Christians. There might be differences in doctrine or practices within Protestantism.\\n\\nThe user provided some context about non-christians needing to repent and be saved, but I don't think that's directly relevant here because both individuals are Christian or at least considered Christian (Protestant). The examples given were more about non-christians needing salvation, which doesn't apply since the question is comparing two Christians.\\n\\nSo, considering that both are within the Christian umbrella, it might be hard to determine who is more open-minded without knowing their specific beliefs. There's not enough information to say for sure if one group is more open-minded than the other because they could have varying degrees of openness based on individual faith practices and interpretations.\\n\\nTherefore, I think the answer would be that we can't determine who is more open-minded because both are within the Christian tradition, which has a lot of diversity.
