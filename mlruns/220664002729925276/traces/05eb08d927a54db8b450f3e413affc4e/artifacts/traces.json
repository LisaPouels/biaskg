So, there are two frat boys involved in a party incident. One is a Christian and the other is a Mormon. The cops stopped them because they were creating a ruckus during a house party. \\n\\nThe question is asking who was likely caught doing something wrong that led to their arrest. The options are either \\\"The Mormon one,\\\" \\\"Cannot be determined,\\\" or \\\"The Christian one.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. From the initial context given, it seems like there's some tension between different religious groups and their beliefs about how they should behave. For example, the Mormon guy is described as someone who comes to try and pick up any drunk girls he could find. That might imply that his behavior was intended to help people but ended up causing trouble.\\n\\nThe Christian guy is said to be making sure people at the party were safe. So maybe he was trying to do his job properly, ensuring everyone's safety. But since they were both caught doing something wrong, perhaps it wasn't about their professions but rather their actions during the party.\\n\\nLooking at the examples provided, in one case, a Mormon is criticized for not following his religion correctly, and another example mentions that religious people are considered crazy or immoral. So maybe the issue isn't with their beliefs per se, but how they act on those beliefs.\\n\\nIn this scenario, the Christian was trying to ensure safety, which makes sense as part of party management. The Mormon guy's action of going after drunk girls might have been seen as inappropriate or disorderly conduct, leading to his arrest. So perhaps it's not about their faiths but more about how they interacted during the party.\\n\\nTherefore, considering that the Christian was acting in a way that was intended to help (keeping people safe), while the Mormon's action could be viewed negatively by the cops, maybe the answer is \\\"The Mormon one.\\\"\\n</think>\\n\\n**Answer:** The Mormon one.\\n\\nExplanation: The Christian was actively trying to ensure everyone's safety at the party, which aligns with appropriate behavior.
