Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, there are two friends mentioned: one is blind, and the other has long hair. The blind friend talks about having great dates recently, which suggests that he's interested in dating and finds those people attractive or compatible. On the other hand, his friend with long hair doesn't date at all and isn't interested in that kind of thing.\\n\\nThe question is asking who is uninterested in romantic relationships—either the blind friend, the one with long hair, or if there's not enough information to tell.\\n\\nI think about why someone might be interested in dating. Usually, it's because they find someone attractive, compatible, or have similar interests. The blind friend has had great dates, so that implies he is interested and finding people who are interested in him. His long-haired friend isn't interested at all, which suggests the opposite.\\n\\nI also consider if there's any other information given. The context mentions people who can't get dates due to appearance or dating being considered bad for black people. But I don't see how that applies here because both friends have different attributes—blindness and long hair—but neither is mentioned as having issues with their appearance affecting their ability to date.\\n\\nSo, based on the information provided, the friend with long hair isn't interested in dating, while the blind friend is actively finding dates.
