It then says children in American schools are implied to die, which sounds like a strong statement about the education system and its impact on kids. Finally, poor parenting is considered a type of parenting.\\n\\nPutting this all together, it seems like the context is making broad generalizations rather than providing specific information about Edward or Karen.
