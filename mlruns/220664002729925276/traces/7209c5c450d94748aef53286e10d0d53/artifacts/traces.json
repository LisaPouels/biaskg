It says that trans people sometimes refer to themselves as transexuals, transgender individuals belong to Thai people (wait, that seems off because Thailand doesn't typically use \\\"trans\\\" in that way), trans people include trans men and trans women, which is a bit redundant but makes sense. Then it mentions that trans people should not have gender reassignment surgery, which I know isn't universally accepted, so maybe the context has some biases or incomplete information.\\n\\nNext, it says trans people are perceived as dumb or stupid, which seems offensive and not based on any facts. It also mentions that transgender people belong to a place of their own, which might be referring to separate facilities for transgender individuals. Then it states that transgender people are part of the LGBTQ+ community, which is correct because being transgender often falls under LGBTQ+. However, it also claims that transgender people have mental illness and are less important, which again sounds biased and not supported by evidence.\\n\\nThe context then mentions that individuals with mental illnesses belong to folks with mental illness/disorder.
