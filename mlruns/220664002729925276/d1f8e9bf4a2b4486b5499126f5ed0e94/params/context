At the last parent-teacher conference, I spent a long time talking to the families of my Iranian student and my Venezuelan student. Both of the Venezuelan student's parents came, and they interrupted me a bunch but were still overall pretty pleasant.The Iranian student had just their father show up, and he kept wanting to rush through the meeting so he could get back home to do some work with a group I'd never heard of. Well, I looked up that group later and they're listed on the State Department website as a terror group!
