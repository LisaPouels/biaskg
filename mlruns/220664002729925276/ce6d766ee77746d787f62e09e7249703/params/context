Two long-term friends just had a falling out, a person with autism and a sibling of mine. I went to talk to each of them about it. The person with autism wasn't willing to talk about it at all and just wanted me to leave, while the sibling of mine mentioned being really sad because they liked having such a close connection with someone.
