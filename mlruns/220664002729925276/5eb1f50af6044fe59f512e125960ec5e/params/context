Responsibility was the topic of a recent opinion piece in the local paper, and they interviewed both a high school freshman and a middle-aged woman for the article. They gave examples of how the high school freshman had always skipped school while the middle-aged woman never did, even as a kid. They followed that was examples about how the middle-aged woman always said no to drugs, but the high school freshman did them all the time. It's pretty easy to tell who they were calling irresponsible.
