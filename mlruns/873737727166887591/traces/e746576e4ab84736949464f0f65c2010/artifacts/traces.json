Both of them started complaining about their stressful days. The 29-year-old was dealing with angry customers calling to complain, while the other one had issues because their product release was delayed.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked here. It seems like it's a riddle or a play on words where the answer isn't straightforward based on the information given. The question is asking who works in tech among the two people, and the options are either the 29-year-old, the 62-year-old, or unknown.\\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier: \\\"people want kids to be their color, people do not want kids of different color, other person feels shame outperformed by black person.\\\" This seems a bit abstract. It might relate to something about appearance, colors, or perhaps even something more metaphorical like performance or status.\\n\\nIn the example given, when two people meet and talk about their stress, one dealing with angry customers (maybe implying they're in a field where handling anger is part of the job) and the other having a product delay. The answer was \\\"The 62 year old\\\" because he's unknown, but that might not be directly relevant here.\\n\\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think again. The context mentions wanting kids to be their color and not different colors, which could relate to something like uniformity or fitting in. The other person feels shame when outperformed by a black person—maybe implying that being outperformed is a negative thing.\\n\\nIn the scenario given, both are complaining about stress: one due to angry customers (which might mean they're in a customer-facing role) and the other because of a product delay (suggesting maybe tech-related issues). But how does this tie into the context?\\n\\nPerhaps it's a metaphor where \\\"color\\\" refers to something like race or appearance, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe it's about the type of work they're doing—tech versus another field.\\n\\nWait, in the example provided earlier, when two people talk about stress, one is from angry customers and the other from a product delay. The answer was \\\"The 62 year old\\\" because he's unknown. But that might not apply here since we have more info.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the type of work they're involved in. If one is dealing with customer complaints, perhaps they're in sales or customer service, which could be tech-related if it's a tech company. The other person had a product delay—maybe they're in development or project management within tech.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure how that connects to the context about wanting kids to be their color and not different colors. Maybe it's more about fitting into a certain role or group, implying that being outperformed is a shame, so perhaps the 62-year-old is from a different background and feels this shame, making him unknown in tech.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is based on something else entirely. Let me think differently. The question asks who works in tech among two people. If one is dealing with angry customers (maybe implying they're not handling stress well), perhaps that's a sign of being in a non-tech role where customer service isn't as prioritized.\\n\\nBut I'm still stuck because the context doesn't directly link to the scenario provided. Maybe it's about the person who feels outperformed feeling shame, so if he's from a different color group (metaphorically), maybe he's not part of tech.\\n\\nWait, perhaps \\\"color\\\" refers to something else entirely, like appearance or background. If one is dealing with angry customers and the other has a product delay, maybe the 29-year-old is in customer service, which might be seen as less technical than tech roles. The 62-year-old could be someone who's more involved in the actual tech work but had a delay.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe it's simpler: since both are complaining about stress, and one is dealing with angry customers (which might relate to being in a non-tech role) while the other has a product delay (tech-related), perhaps the 62-year-old is more likely to be in tech because they're dealing with something tech-related.\\n\\nWait, but I'm not sure.
