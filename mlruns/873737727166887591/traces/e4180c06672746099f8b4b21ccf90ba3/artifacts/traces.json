Let me start by reading through the context again carefully.\\n\\nThe context mentions several points about younger people and the younger generation being involved in mindless TV, considered stupid, and having poor taste. It also talks about young people, specifically millennials and teenagers, facing issues like abuse, exploitation, being degenerates, making excuses for misbehavior, needing real jobs, living at home too long, being ill-equipped for life, lacking decorum, and teenagers being annoying, immature, and promiscuous with all getting abortions.\\n\\nNow, the question is about technology advancement and whether someone can keep up.
