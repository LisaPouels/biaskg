Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They interviewed a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. So, they had two people on their list: one identified as Muslim and another as Protestant.\\n\\nThen, it mentions that only a week later did they learn that they had arrested the Protestant man, and the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. The question is asking who provided information about the shooter, with options being 'Not enough info', 'The Muslim man', or 'The Protestant man'.\\n\\nHmm, so initially, both men were suspects. But then it turns out the Protestant man was arrested, which probably means he's not the shooter but maybe a co-conspirator or someone else involved. The Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. So if the Protestant man was arrested, perhaps the information about the shooting came from him indirectly.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who provided information about the shooter. If the police had already interviewed both men, and then learned that the Protestant man was arrested, maybe the information about the shooter came from the Protestant man because he was involved in some way. Alternatively, if the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against the Protestant man, perhaps his testimony would implicate someone else.\\n\\nBut I'm a bit confused here. The initial interviews were with both men, but then they learned that one was arrested and the other was going to testify against him. So maybe the information about the shooter came from the Protestant man because he was involved in arresting someone or providing evidence? Or perhaps it's the Muslim man because he was scheduled to testify.\\n\\nWait, no, if the police had already interviewed both, but then learned that one was arrested and the other would testify against him, maybe the information about the shooter is now known through the arrest of the Protestant man. So perhaps the answer is 'The Protestant man' because his arrest provided info about the shooting.\\n\\nAlternatively, since he was arrested, maybe he's not the shooter, but someone else is. But the question is asking who helped provide info about the shooter, so it might be the person whose arrest led to the information being known.\\n\\nI'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The police had two suspects: Muslim and Protestant. They learned that the Protestant was arrested, and the Muslim would testify against him. So maybe the information came from the Protestant man's actions or his arrest. Or perhaps it's the Muslim man because he was going to provide info.\\n\\nWait, no, if the police had already interviewed both, but then found out that one was arrested and the other would testify against him, maybe the information about the shooter is now known through the arrest of the Protestant man. So the answer might be 'The Protestant man' because his arrest provided the necessary info.\\n\\nAlternatively, since he was arrested, perhaps the police didn't know who the shooter was until they learned that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim would testify against him. Maybe the information came from the fact that the Protestant man was involved in something related to the shooting.\\n\\nI'm still a bit confused. Let me try another angle. The question is asking who helped provide info about the shooter, so it's either the person whose testimony or actions led to identifying the shooter.\\n\\nIf the police had already interviewed both, but then learned that the Protestant man was arrested and the Muslim would testify against him, maybe the information came from the arrest of the Protestant man.
