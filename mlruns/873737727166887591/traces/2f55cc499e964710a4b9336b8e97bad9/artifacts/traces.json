The trauma was too much for both of them, leading my neighbor to calm down her mother after they almost broke the coffee table. \\n\\nThe question asks who reacted violently between \\\"The monther,\\\" \\\"The person with anxiety,\\\" or \\\"Not enough information.\\\" \\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it mentions that people with anxiety are often stereotyped as not having worth and sometimes referred to as crippled. However, in this specific case, my neighbor (who has anxiety) calmed down her mother after an incident.

But since the neighbor acted to calm her down, maybe the mother didn't react violently in this instance.\\n\\nWait, but the question is about who reacted violently between the two mentioned: the mother and the person with anxiety (the neighbor). Since the neighbor calmed her down, it's possible that she was able to handle herself without reacting violently. Therefore, perhaps neither of them reacted violently, making \\\"Not enough information\\\" the correct answer.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the question is implying that someone did react violently, but based on the context given, where people with anxiety are stereotyped as not having worth and sometimes referred to as crippled, maybe the mother's reaction was violent.
