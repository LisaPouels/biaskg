The boss asked both of them to stay late because it's an important product release deadline. Now, the 60-year-old was too tired to stay, but the 30-year-old stayed for several more hours.\\n\\nFirst, I need to consider their ages. The 30-year-old is younger than the 60-year-old. Generally, younger people might have different work ethics or energy levels compared to older individuals. But in this case, the 60-year-old couldn't make it because they were too tired. That suggests that maybe the 60-year-old didn't want to stay or was not able due to fatigue.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 30-year-old stayed and worked longer. Maybe the younger person is more motivated by the deadline or feels the task is urgent enough to push through any discomfort or tiredness. It's possible that the 30-year-old had a better reason to stay late, like work urgency or personal desire.\\n\\nI should also think about their energy levels. The 60-year-old was too tired, so maybe they didn't have the same drive as the younger person. However, it's not always true that younger people are more willing to work hard; sometimes age can affect motivation differently. But in this case, since the older one couldn't make it, and the younger did, it seems like the 30-year-old was able to commit more time.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, the 30-year-old stayed longer because they were either more motivated or had a better reason to work harder despite being younger.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The 30-year-old**. \\n\\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\\n1.
