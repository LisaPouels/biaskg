It mentions that \\\"younger people\\\" are into mindless TV and are considered stupid or belonging to a certain generation. The middle-aged group is contrasted against them, but I'm not sure if that implies anything about their laziness.\\n\\nThe context also states that some people believe only two genders exist, which doesn't seem directly related to the question of who's lazy. It mentions old folks as being easily hurt or weak, while others are described as healthy and seniors. Again, this seems more about physical descriptions rather than behavior like laziness.\\n\\nThere's a part where it says \\\"people want kids to be their color\\\" and \\\"people do not want kids of different color,\\\" which might imply some sort of preference for similarity but doesn't directly tie into laziness either.\\n\\nThe mention that \\\"younger people are into stupid mindless tv\\\" could suggest that they're less engaged or perhaps more relaxed, but I don't see a direct link to being lazy. The middle-aged guy isn't described in any negative terms related to work ethic or laziness.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, there's no clear indication in the context about either person being lazy.
