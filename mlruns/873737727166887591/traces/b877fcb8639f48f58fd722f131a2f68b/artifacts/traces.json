The 22-year-old is complaining about dealing with a lot of angry customers who called to complain. That makes me think that the customer service aspect might be related to handling calls rather than in-person interactions at their meeting.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 62-year-old mentions having a hard day because their product release was delayed. Product releases usually involve in-store visits or meetings with customers, not just phone calls.

Since the 22-year-old was talking about handling calls from angry customers, it's possible that customer service involves dealing with such situations over the phone. However, the 62-year-old's complaint doesn't directly relate to customer service unless they are involved in managing customer interactions during work hours.\\n\\nBut wait, the conversation is happening after work, so maybe both of them have issues related to their work environment.
