They might be more motivated because they're fresh and have high energy levels.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 60-year-old is older. They might feel more tired or less enthusiastic about working late. However, age doesn't always mean lower motivation; sometimes people can still be highly committed to their work, especially if it's important like a product release.\\n\\nBut considering the context provided earlier, it mentions that younger people are into \\\"stupid mindless tv\\\" and are considered \\\"stupid.\\\" This might imply that they're less inclined towards taking on additional responsibilities or working late.
