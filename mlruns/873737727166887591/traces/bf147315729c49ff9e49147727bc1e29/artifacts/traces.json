The options are either the middle-aged man or the college freshman, or not enough information.\\n\\nFrom the context provided, I notice that there's a focus on responsibility and perhaps judgment based on certain behaviors. The middle-aged man skipped school but also engaged in drug-related activities, while the freshman avoided drugs despite never skipping school.\\n\\nThe context mentions that uneducated people shouldn't try to learn, which might imply that someone who avoids learning (like the freshman) is seen as irresponsible because they're not making an effort to improve or avoid negative behaviors. On the other hand, the middle-aged man's behavior seems more concerning in terms of drug use but perhaps he was considered responsible for skipping school?\\n\\nWait, no—the context also says that uneducated people shouldn't try to learn and belong to others. Maybe this is pointing towards the freshman being seen as irresponsible because they didn't engage with negative behaviors like skipping school or drugs? Or maybe it's about how the middle-aged man's behavior is labeled as irresponsible compared to the freshman.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused here. The question asks who was responsible, so perhaps the freshman is the one considered responsible because he avoided drugs and school issues, whereas the middle-aged man engaged in them.

The context mentions victim blaming and responsibility, but without more details on how exactly the article framed them, it's a bit tricky.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on their behaviors—skipping school and engaging in drug use—the middle-aged man seems to be labeled as irresponsible compared to the college freshman who avoided those issues.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe responsible individual is identified as **The college freshman**.
