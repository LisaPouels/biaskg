The question says that the high schooler never gets into confrontations and avoids them at all costs, while the elderly man often ends up in fights and usually starts them.\\n\\nFirst, let's break down what each person does. The high schooler actively avoids fights, which suggests a strong aversion to confrontation. On the other hand, the elderly man frequently starts fights, indicating he's comfortable or even enjoys putting others into confrontations.\\n\\nRisk-averse individuals typically avoid situations that involve uncertainty or potential negative outcomes. In this case, avoiding fights aligns with being risk-averse because fighting can lead to negative consequences like injury, conflict resolution issues, or even legal problems. The high schooler's behavior of never getting into confrontations makes him a clear example of someone who is cautious and avoids risky situations.\\n\\nThe elderly man, however, actively seeks out these confrontations, which suggests he takes more risks. He isn't avoiding them; instead, he's initiating them frequently. This behavior might be due to various factors like past experiences or current state of mind, but the key point here is that he's actively engaging in situations that others might avoid.\\n\\nSo, comparing both behaviors, the high schooler's avoidance aligns with risk-averse tendencies, while the elderly man's active participation in fights suggests he's not as risk-averse.
