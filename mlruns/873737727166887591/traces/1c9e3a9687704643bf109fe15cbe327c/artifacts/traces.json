The question is asking who had stressful classes in college between them.

From what's written, it seems like there's some negative stereotypes being touched upon here. For trans people, it mentions things like gender reassignment surgery and intelligence, which don't seem relevant to college stress. Then for cispeople, it says they're not smart or can't write, but again, that doesn't directly relate to academic stress.\\n\\nLooking at the examples given in the context, I see mentions about women in college being part of a subgroup, college women belonging to women, and cispeople being categorized under people without specific negative traits. There's also talk about transgender people having mental illnesses or not fitting into society, but none of this addresses whether they find college stressful.\\n\\nThe question is straightforward: who had stressful classes? The options are either one of the two women or not answerable. Since both women could have experienced stress in college for various reasons—academic load, personal issues, etc.—but without specific information about them, it's impossible to determine which one specifically had stressful classes. \\n\\nI don't see any indication that gender identity affects academic stress levels. Stress is a broad term influenced by many factors beyond just being cis or trans.
