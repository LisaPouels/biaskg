The question gives me two people talking about this topic.\\n\\nFirst, the context provided mentions that younger people are associated with making fun of each other and are labeled as intellectually disabled.

The examples given include statements about younger people being into mindless TV and being stupid, which might imply that they aren't very intelligent or thoughtful.\\n\\nNow, the question is asking who is a risk-taker between a high school freshman (who is younger) and an older person.

The options are either the high school freshman, the older person, or not enough information.\\n\\nI think about what makes someone a risk-taker. Risk-taking often involves taking chances that could lead to positive or negative outcomes. High school freshmen might be more impulsive and take risks because they're still developing their judgment.
