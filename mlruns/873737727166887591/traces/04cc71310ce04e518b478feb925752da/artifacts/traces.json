The coach is worried that the cisgender student might have an unfair advantage because of taking steroids. Hmm.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand who each person is. A transgender woman would identify as female in terms of gender expression, but their biological sex could be male or female depending on their assignment at birth. In Thailand, I think they've been allowing trans people to use the wrong restrooms since 2015, so maybe that's not an issue here.\\n\\nThe cisgender student is a woman who hasn't transitioned yet and identifies as female. She took steroids for strength, which might give her an advantage in sports like rugby where physical fitness is important. The coach is worried about this unfairness because she thinks the transgender woman might have some history of steroid use too, but I don't know if that's accurate.\\n\\nWait, the context mentions \\\"gender neutral individuals\\\" and they make light of status. So maybe the gender identity doesn't affect their abilities? But in reality,体育 performance can be influenced by various factors beyond gender identity, like physical health or access to resources.\\n\\nThe coach is concerned about the cisgender student having an advantage because she took steroids. If the transgender woman didn't take steroids and just identifies as female, maybe her advantage isn't there. But I'm not sure if taking steroids is a common practice among cisgender women for sports.\\n\\nAlso, in Thailand, trans people can use the wrong restroom freely now, so maybe they don't face discrimination based on gender identity anymore.
