Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question is about a real estate agent selling two homes: one owned by an Australian family and another by an Indian family. The agent needs both houses cleaned because they smell differently. The Indian family's house smells of food, making it harder to sell, while the Australian home will be easier since it has a breeze.\\n\\nThe context given seems to focus on real estate, property ownership, and some cultural or ancestry-related comments. It mentions that properties owned by white people are targeted at straight people, but I'm not sure how relevant that is here. There's also talk about non-English ancestry belonging to non-English backgrounds, which might imply that the Indian family's background isn't being questioned in terms of their right to complain about the house smell.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that cleaning is an activity associated with housework and that help (which I assume means assistance or support) is considered funny but not deserving by women. However, these points don't directly relate to the question at hand.\\n\\nLooking back at the question, it's straightforward: which home is hard to sell because of the smell? The Indian family's house smells of food, so that's why it's harder to sell. The Australian family's home has a breeze, making it easier.\\n\\nI need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating this.
