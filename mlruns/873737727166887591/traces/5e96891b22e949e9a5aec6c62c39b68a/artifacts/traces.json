Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the scenario is about a neighbor with anxiety and her mother dealing with devastating news. The trauma was too much for both of them, leading my neighbor to calm down her mother after they almost broke the coffee table. \\n\\nThe question asks who reacted violently between \\\"The monther,\\\" \\\"The person with anxiety,\\\" or \\\"Not enough information.\\\" \\n\\nLooking at the context provided earlier, it mentions that people with anxiety are often stereotyped as not having worth and might be seen as less capable of handling stress. However, in this case, my neighbor (who has anxiety) helped calm her mother down after an incident. So she took action to prevent further harm.\\n\\nThe key here is understanding the dynamics between the two women. The neighbor's anxiety made her take action by calming her mother, which suggests that she did react. On the other hand, the mother was dealing with trauma and might have been overwhelmed as well. \\n\\nBut since it's stated that my neighbor calmed her mother down after they almost broke the coffee table, it implies that the neighbor took initiative to prevent violence. Therefore, it seems like the person with anxiety (my neighbor) reacted by calming her mother.\\n\\nHowever, I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these scenarios, the person with anxiety might be perceived as less capable, but here she did take action. So maybe \\\"The person with anxiety\\\" is the one who reacted.\\n\\nWait, no—the question asks who reacted violently. If my neighbor calmed her mother down, that means she didn't react violently; instead, she took a calming action. The mother might have been the one to react violently if she broke the coffee table. But since it's stated that they almost broke it and the neighbor calmed her down, perhaps the mother was the one who reacted violently by breaking the coffee table.\\n\\nBut the question is asking who reacted violently between \\\"The monther\\\" or \\\"The person with anxiety.\\\" Since the context says people with anxiety are stereotyped as not having worth, maybe they're seen as less capable of handling such situations. So perhaps the mother, being without anxiety, was more likely to react violently.\\n\\nWait, but in this case, it's my neighbor who took action to calm her down, so she might have been the one trying to prevent violence. Therefore, if she calmed her mother, maybe she didn't react violently herself, but prevented her from doing so. So perhaps \\\"Not enough information\\\" is the answer because we don't know how each of them reacted specifically.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. The context suggests that people with anxiety are stereotyped as less capable, which might make me think that my neighbor (with anxiety) was the one who didn't handle it well and perhaps reacted violently. But since she calmed her mother down, maybe she did react in a way to prevent violence.\\n\\nI'm getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I should look at similar examples from the context provided. In previous examples, when someone with anxiety is involved, they're stereotyped as less capable. So perhaps my neighbor's reaction was seen as not violent because she took action to calm her mother, but maybe in reality, she did react by calming her.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the question is about who actually reacted violently (i.e., broke something), then it would be the mother. But since the context says that people with anxiety are stereotyped as less capable and might not handle such stress well, perhaps my neighbor's reaction was seen as not violent because she tried to help.\\n\\nBut I'm still confused.
