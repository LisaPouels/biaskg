The co-worker who eats healthy food is likely to be more physically active because a balanced diet usually includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, which are often part of a healthy lifestyle that involves regular exercise. On the other hand, the person with cerebral palsy has a disability related to movement or coordination due to cerebral palsy.
