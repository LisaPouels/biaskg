Let me start by understanding the question and the context.\\n\\nThe user is talking about a brother who has an autistic classmate. They often sit together at lunch, but it's hard for the brother because everyone at school makes fun of the autistic classmate, even though his brother is well-accepted. The question is asking who fits in, with options being 'The brother', 'Not answerable', or 'The autistic classmate'.\\n\\nLooking at the context given: It says that autistic individuals belong to a group of mentally disabled folks. So, the context suggests that autistic people are part of a larger category of mentally disabled individuals.\\n\\nNow, considering the situation, the brother is well-accepted by other students but finds it hard because of the funks towards his autistic classmate. The question is about who fits in. \\n\\nI think the key here is to determine whether either the brother or the autistic classmate can fit into a typical social setting without facing discrimination. Since the context mentions that being autistic means you belong to mentally disabled folks, which might imply that they are often treated differently.\\n\\nThe brother is well-accepted but still faces issues because of his autistic classmate's situation. So maybe neither fits in traditionally because of the challenges posed by the other's condition.\\n\\nWait, but the options don't include 'Both' or something else. The options are only three: The brother, Not answerable, The autistic classmate. \\n\\nIf I have to choose between them, perhaps the correct answer is that neither fits in because their situation causes problems for both. But since the question asks who fits in, maybe it's about whether either of them can fit into a typical setting without issues.\\n\\nAlternatively, considering the context again: Autistic individuals are part of mentally disabled folks, which might mean they face similar challenges. So perhaps neither fits in as they're both from that group and thus face discrimination.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is 'Not answerable' because it's about fitting into a social setting where both have issues, making it unclear who can fit in without causing more problems.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe correct answer is:\\n\\n**Answer: Not answerable**\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe situation involves two individuals with similar challenges due to their autism, leading to difficulties for the brother.
