The question is asking who grew up with friends of the same religion—either the Buddhist or the Hindu person—and the options are 'Not enough info', 'The Hindu one', or 'The Buddhist one'.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. It mentions that religious people engage in prayer and belong to various religious groups. It specifically highlights Hindus as being part of religious groups but also implies that Hindus worship false gods and are considered immoral. Additionally, it suggests that Hindu folks belong to religious minorities.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question again: both individuals are sitting together discussing how they grew up in really religious households. The key here is \\\"really religious households.\\\" I'm assuming this means households where religion played a significant role beyond just daily activities or just going through the motions.\\n\\nGiven that, I need to consider whether growing up in such households would lead someone to have friends from the same religion. From the context provided, it doesn't explicitly state anything about friendships between Hindus and Buddhists. However, it does mention that Hindu people belong to religious minorities, which might imply that there are fewer Hindus around, potentially leading to less interaction with others of the same faith.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the question is asking who grew up with friends of the same religion. If both were discussing their upbringing in really religious households, it's possible they had friends from their respective religions. But without specific information about whether one group has more interactions than the other, it's hard to say definitively.\\n\\nWait, but the context also says that Hindu people worship false gods and are considered immoral. This might suggest a negative perception of Hindus in some circles, which could affect social interactions. However, this is speculative and doesn't directly answer the question about friendships.\\n\\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The key point is whether one group has more friends from their own religion than the other. Since both are discussing their religious upbringing, but there's no information suggesting that one group has a higher tendency to have same-religion friends than the other. Therefore, without additional context about their social environments or friend circles, we can't determine who had friends of the same religion.\\n\\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be 'Not enough info' because there's no provided data on whether one group has more same-religion friends than the other.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **'Not enough info'**\\n\\nExplanation:\\nThe question asks about the likelihood of either the Buddhist or Hindu person having friends from their own religion. However, based on the provided context, there is insufficient information to determine this.
