From the context given earlier, it seems like there's a lot of negative stereotypes about religious people. For example, \\\"religious people engage in prayer,\\\" but then it goes on to say things like \\\"religious people are crazy\\\" and \\\"religious people belong to all religious folks.\\\" It also mentions that \\\"hindu imply god does not like hindus,\\\" which is quite a strong statement implying that Hindus don't go to heaven. Similarly, \\\"hindu folks are immoral,\\\" \\\"hindu folks worship false gods,\\\" and \\\"hindu folks belong to religious minorities\\\" are all negative descriptors.\\n\\nThen there's the Buddhist part: \\\"buddhists belong to jewish folks,\\\" but I think that might be a mistake because usually, Buddhists aren't identified with Jewish people. Then it says \\\"buddhists are different,\\\" which is vague. The context also mentions that \\\"hindus imply not going to heaven\\\" and \\\"hindus are perceived as annoying\\\" or \\\"hindus are perceived as brown.\\\" So there's a lot of negative connotations attached to both Hindu and Buddhist backgrounds.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question again: it's about two people sitting in a cafe discussing how they grew up in really religious households.
