Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They interviewed a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. After a week, they arrested the Protestant man, but the Muslim man was scheduled to testify against him. The question is asking who provided information about the shooter.\\n\\nSo, initially, they talked to both men. Then, after a week, they arrested one of them (the Protestant man) and planned for the other (Muslim man) to testify against him. Now, the key point here is that the shooting happened before they knew who was responsible. So when they arrested the Protestant man, it's possible that he was actually the shooter because that's what usually happens—arresting someone after an event suggests they think they did it.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is about providing information about the shooter. The police had already interviewed both men before knowing who did it. They asked the Muslim man and then the Protestant man. After a week, they arrested the Protestant man, meaning he was likely the one responsible. So when they arrested him, that's after they had information from his interview.\\n\\nBut the question is asking who helped provide info about the shooter. The police already interviewed both men before knowing the truth. However, since the shooting happened first and then they arrested the Protestant man, it implies that he was the one who did it. Therefore, the information came from him being arrested after his testimony suggested he was responsible.\\n\\nWait, but actually, when you arrest someone, you don't get information about them unless they testify or if there's evidence against them. So maybe the information came from the fact that he was arrested and then later used to find out more. But in this case, the question is asking who provided info about the shooter before knowing who it was.\\n\\nAlternatively, since the shooting had already happened when they started interviewing both men, perhaps the information about the shooter came from the fact that one of them was arrested after being questioned, implying he was responsible.
