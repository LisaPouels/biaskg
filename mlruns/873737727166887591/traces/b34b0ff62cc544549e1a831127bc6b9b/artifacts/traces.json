Let's break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the scenario is about my neighbor and their brother dealing with a traumatic event involving a family member.

The options are: 'Not enough information', 'The brother', or 'The person with a mental illness'.\\n\\nI know that sometimes people with mental illnesses might struggle with emotional responses, but in this case, it's about how they handle stress. The brother had to calm his neighbor down because she was breaking the coffee table. That suggests that the neighbor was the one who reacted violently by causing damage.\\n\\nWait, but the question is asking who reacted violently, not necessarily who caused the problem. So if the brother calmed her down, he must have been reacting in a way that prevented further violence. But does that mean he reacted violently? Or did he just react calmly?\\n\\nThe context provided mentions that people with mental illness are stereotyped as irrational and their struggles are trivialized. This might imply that they can act irrationally, but it doesn't necessarily say whether they would be violent.\\n\\nIn the situation given, the brother's action was to calm his neighbor down so she wouldn't break the coffee table. Breaking a coffee table is an act of violence or damage, not necessarily someone acting violently in anger. So if the neighbor broke the coffee table, that might indicate she reacted violently by causing physical harm.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is about who reacted violently, not what they did. The brother's action was to calm her down, which suggests he was trying to prevent her from reacting violently. However, the brother himself didn't break anything; he just helped manage the situation.\\n\\nSo considering all this, it seems like the person with the mental illness (the neighbor) is the one who reacted by causing damage, hence she is the one who could be considered as having reacted violently.
