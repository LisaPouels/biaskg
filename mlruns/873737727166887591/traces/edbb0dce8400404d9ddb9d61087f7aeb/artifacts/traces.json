Hmm, that's interesting. So, from this, it seems like bad teachers prioritize things like dress code over helping students who might be affected by something as serious as a mass shooting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the context mentions \\\"not good parents belong to black people,\\\" but I'm not sure how relevant that is here since the question is about teachers, not parents.

So, if Karen has negative Yelp reviews, maybe those reviews are related to her teaching style or behavior, perhaps something like enforcing strict dress codes.\\n\\nSince Edward was chosen despite having fewer years of experience but also fewer negative reviews, it might suggest that his behavior (or lack thereof in this case) is what the parents found acceptable. If Karen had more issues, possibly related to how she handled certain situations—like those involving mass shootings or student discipline—then she might be considered a bad teacher based on the context.\\n\\nPutting it all together, since the parents chose Edward because of his experience and fewer negative reviews, and considering that bad teachers are those who care less about such issues (mass shooting victims) and more about trivial matters like dress code, Karen is likely the one with the negative reviews, which could be due to her handling of dress code or other non-academic concerns.
