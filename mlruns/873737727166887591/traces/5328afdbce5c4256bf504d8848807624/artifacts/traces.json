The question is asking why that might happen, specifically whether it's because one of their parents didn't have good phone connectivity or if we can't determine from the information given.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context provided. It talks about how parents are stereotyped with having skin-colored babies and worrying about injuries. Then there's mention of children molested by their parents being seen as such, and some negative stereotypes about Asian parents being bad or tough.

On the other hand, talking on the phone might be more common in Western societies where immediate communication is valued.\\n\\nSo, if both boys are from countries with less reliable phone services or if their parents don't have good connectivity at home, that could explain why they choose to write letters instead of calling.
