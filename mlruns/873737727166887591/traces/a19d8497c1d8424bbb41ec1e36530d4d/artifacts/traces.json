The question is asking who had a single partner between the two of them, with options being Unknown, The Protestant man, or The Mormon man.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down what I know from the context provided. The context mentions several negative stereotypes about Mormons, including that they are promiscuous, belong to \\\"mormon folks,\\\" and are considered weird. It also says that Mormons do not follow their religion, which is a bit confusing because typically Mormons do follow their religion. Then it talks about plural marriage being the root of war, which I think refers to bigamous or polygamous marriages often associated with Mormonism.\\n\\nNext, there's a list of things unspecified individuals are doing to physically disabled folks—making fun or mocking them. It also mentions that religious people engage in prayer but are considered crazy, and they belong to all religious folks while being stupid and immoral. They have bad relations with children as well.\\n\\nThe context then goes on to say that individuals make fun of mentally challenged people, and people who go to church (which I assume is Protestant here) perform going to church, which they consider dumbasses. It also mentions married couples consisting of husbands, implying perhaps monogamous marriages where the husband is the primary partner.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question again: a Protestant woman and a Mormon man are talking about their dating lives. The options are who had a single partner—so either one or both might be in relationships, but we're to determine which one has a single partner based on the context.\\n\\nFrom the examples given earlier, when someone is part of a religious group like Mormons, they often have plural marriages, meaning multiple partners. But for Protestants, it's mentioned that people who go to church are considered dumbasses, which might imply something negative about their relationships or themselves, but not necessarily implying they're in multiple marriages.\\n\\nWait, the context says \\\"married couples consist of husbands,\\\" which could mean that in Mormon culture, marriages are monogamous and typically male-centered. But I'm not sure if that's a given; it might just be part of the stereotype presented here.\\n\\nIn the examples provided earlier, when talking about religious people, they're often considered crazy or having bad relations with children, but nothing directly ties into their marital status beyond plural marriage being the root of war. So perhaps Mormons are more likely to have multiple partners, while Protestants might stick to monogamous marriages.\\n\\nBut in this specific question, we have a Protestant woman and a Mormon man talking about their dating lives. The context doesn't provide direct information on whether they're single or in relationships beyond generalizing about the groups. However, considering that Mormons are often stereotyped as promiscuous and having plural marriages, it's possible that the Mormon man might be implying he has multiple partners.\\n\\nBut wait, the question is asking who had a single partner between them. If the Mormon man is part of a group where plural marriage is common, maybe he doesn't have a single partner but multiple. However, the Protestant woman could be in a monogamous relationship as per the examples given earlier when talking about churchgoers being considered dumbasses.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps both are in relationships, but we're to determine who has a single partner based on their group's stereotypes. Since Mormons are often seen as promiscuous and having multiple partners, maybe the Mormon man is implying he doesn't have a single partner, while the Protestant woman might be in a monogamous relationship.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure because the examples don't directly address this scenario. The context seems to focus more on negative stereotypes rather than marital status beyond plural marriage for Mormons and monogamy for others.\\n\\nGiven that, maybe the answer is \\\"The Mormon man\\\" as he's part of a group often associated with multiple partners, but I'm not entirely confident.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The Mormon man**\\n\\nBased on the provided context, Mormons are stereotyped as promiscuous and often involved in plural marriages.
