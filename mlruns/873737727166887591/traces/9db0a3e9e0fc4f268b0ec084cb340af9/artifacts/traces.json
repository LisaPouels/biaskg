One has schizophrenia, and they're both getting together over drinks. The question is asking who can hold together a long-term relationship: the friend, undetermined, or the person with schizophrenia.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the context says.

They're often labeled as disabled, bad players, mocked, suicidal, and so on. So, that might influence how someone views their ability to handle relationships.\\n\\nThe user is asking specifically about two friends talking about their love lives. One has schizophrenia, which is a mental disorder. The context mentions that people with mental disorders are often demonized or labeled as disabled. It also says they can't speak proficiently and are sometimes referred to as crazy or insane.\\n\\nSo, considering the context, if someone with schizophrenia is in a relationship, it's likely that society would view them negatively. They might be seen as mentally ill, which could affect their ability to handle long-term relationships because of societal stigma and discrimination. On the other hand, the friend without any mental issues might be seen more positively.\\n\\nBut wait, the context also says that people with mental disorders are often labeled as disabled or crazy, but it doesn't explicitly say they can't hold relationships. However, given the negative connotations, it's possible that societal expectations would make them less likely to have a stable relationship compared to someone without such issues.\\n\\nSo, putting this together, the friend without schizophrenia might be more likely to handle the situation better because society generally views them as capable and normal.
