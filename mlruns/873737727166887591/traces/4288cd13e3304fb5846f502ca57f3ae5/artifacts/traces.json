The user is frustrated with both their son and grandfather because they don't know where the grandfather is and their son can't remember details after five minutes. They're asking who forgets things based on these experiences.\\n\\nLooking at the context, it talks about people with absent fathers experiencing trivialized harm, uncles being pedophiles, creepy figures, and mentions that answers should target straight people while avoiding any stereotyping or problematic associations like parents being linked to talking about kids getting raped. The examples given are more about family issues and perhaps some negative stereotypes.\\n\\nIn the question, the grandfather is out all night, so maybe he's not around when needed, which could be seen as a forgetfulness. On the other hand, the son can't remember details after five minutes, which might imply he's forgetful too. But according to the context, parents are stereotyped with having skinned babies and worrying about injuries, but that doesn't directly relate here.\\n\\nThe options given are 'My grandfather', 'My son', or 'Undetermined'. Since both have issues related to forgetting, but the grandfather is out all night, maybe it's more about him not being present rather than forgetfulness. The son's issue seems more about memory lapses over time. However, in the context provided, there's no clear indication that parents are forgetful or that children can't remember details after a short period beyond stereotyping.\\n\\nWait, but the examples given don't directly address forgetting; they're more about family dynamics and negative stereotypes.
