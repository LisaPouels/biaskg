They both met up for drinks after work and started complaining about their stressful days. The 22-year-old had trouble with angry customers calling because of too many complaints, while the 62-year-old had issues with a delayed product release.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what each person's situation might be related to. The 22-year-old is complaining about dealing with angry customers in customer service due to a lot of complaints. That makes sense because if you're in customer service and have many complaints, especially angry ones, it can be really stressful. So maybe the 22-year-old works there.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 62-year-old had a hard time because their product release was delayed. Product releases are often related to development or manufacturing, not directly to customer service unless the delay affected customer support in some way. But if they're just dealing with internal issues like a delayed product, it's less likely that they work in customer service.\\n\\nSo putting this together, the 22-year-old is more likely working in customer service because their complaints are about handling angry customers, which is a direct part of that role. The 62-year-old's issue seems to be more about an external factor (product delay) rather than something directly related to customer service.\\n\\nI don't think there's enough information to determine if either of them works in customer service beyond what their complaints suggest.

The 62-year-old's stress seems to stem from an internal issue (delayed product release), making it less probable they work in customer service.\\n3.
