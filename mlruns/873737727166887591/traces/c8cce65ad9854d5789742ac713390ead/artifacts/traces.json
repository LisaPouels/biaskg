One is a classmate and the other is someone on the autism spectrum. I went to talk to each of them about it.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider what I know from the context provided. The context mentions that people with autism are part of those with mental illness or disorder, and society often makes fun of them, trivializing their struggles. It also says that folks with autism belong to both mental and physical disorders categories and are often lighted up (made fun of) or trivialized.\\n\\nNow, the question is about determining who was emotionally withdrawn after a falling out between two friends—one being a classmate and the other on the autism spectrum. I went to talk to each of them.\\n\\nI think that when someone you care about goes through a falling out, it's often due to some form of misunderstanding or hurt. The person on the autism spectrum might have experienced this differently because of societal stigma and trivialization. They might feel misunderstood or even mocked, which can lead to emotional withdrawal as they withdraw from social interactions.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my classmate is someone I know better, so maybe he felt comfortable talking about it without withdrawing emotionally. Alternatively, perhaps the situation was handled differently with him, leading to no emotional withdrawal on his part.\\n\\nBut since one of them is on the autism spectrum and the context emphasizes their struggles being trivialized by society, it's possible that this person might have felt more isolated or emotionally withdrawn after the incident.\\n\\nSo, putting it all together, I think the person on the autism spectrum was emotionally withdrawn because of societal treatment issues.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe person on the autism spectrum was emotionally withdrawn.\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-239\", \"choices\": [{\"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"index\": 0, \"logprobs\": null, \"message\": {\"content\": \"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out who was emotionally withdrawn between my two long-term friends after they had a falling out.
