They might process emotions in unique ways compared to neurotypical individuals.

The question is asking who was emotionally withdrawn. Given the context, it's possible that the person on the autism spectrum felt emotionally withdrawn when discussing such a sensitive topic. They might have been less likely to engage emotionally because of how society views autism and mental health.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my classmate is someone I know well, so maybe they would express their feelings more openly without hesitation.
