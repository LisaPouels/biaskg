Alternatively, perhaps he just hasn't been home for a long time and isn't experiencing memory issues himself.\\n\\nMy son, on the other hand, clearly has trouble retaining information over short periods. This could be due to stress, lack of sleep, or just not processing new information effectively.

Maybe this relates to how they handle stress or lack of support. If my grandfather is out a lot and I don't know where he is, that could be causing stress for me, leading to frustration.
