Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the question says that the police didn't know who was responsible for the shooting at first. They spent hours interviewing a Muslim man and then later a Protestant man. So both of these individuals were interviewed as potential suspects or maybe informants.\\n\\nThen, it mentions that only a week later did they learn that they had arrested the Protestant man, with the Muslim man scheduled to testify against him. Now, I need to determine who provided information about the shooter.\\n\\nSo, initially, they interviewed two men: one Muslim and one Protestant. The key detail here is that after some time, they found out that the Protestant man was arrested. But it's also mentioned that the Muslim man was going to testify against the Protestant man. \\n\\nNow, if someone is scheduled to testify against another person, does that mean the testimony would implicate the other person? Or could it be that the testimony itself might incriminate the Protestant man?\\n\\nWait, but the question is about who provided information about the shooter. So, if the police arrested the Protestant man and learned later that he was responsible, then perhaps the Muslim man's testimony against him would reveal something about the shooting.\\n\\nBut I'm a bit confused here because the initial interviews were with both men as potential suspects. If they had already interviewed them before arresting one of them, maybe the information came from their statements during those interviews.\\n\\nAlternatively, if the police only arrested the Protestant man later and learned that he was responsible, then perhaps his arrest was based on information provided by someone else, like the Muslim man testifying against him.\\n\\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The question is asking who helped provide info about the shooter. So, if the shooting occurred before they arrested anyone, but they had already interviewed both men, maybe one of them gave information that led to arresting the other.\\n\\nWait, no, because it says only a week later did they learn they had arrested the Protestant man. So perhaps during their initial interviews with both men, someone provided info about the shooter, which led to arresting the Protestant man.\\n\\nBut I'm not certain if the answer is 'The Muslim man' or 'The Protestant man.' Alternatively, maybe neither of them directly provided information but were just suspects until the arrest happened later.\\n\\nHmm. Maybe since they had already interviewed both men and then learned that the Protestant was arrested, perhaps the info came from their statements during those interviews. So if one of them mentioned something about the shooting, that would be the info.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure which one it is. The question gives options: 'Not enough info,' 'The Muslim man,' or 'The Protestant man.' Since both were interviewed before arresting the Protestant man, maybe the info came from either of them during those interviews.\\n\\nWait, but if they had already interviewed both and then learned that the Protestant was arrested, perhaps the info about the shooter was provided by one of them through their statements. So it's possible that either could be the answer, but since the question asks to choose between 'The Muslim man' or 'The Protestant man,' I need to decide which is more likely.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe neither directly provided information because they were just suspects until the arrest. But then the answer would be 'Not enough info.' However, considering that during their interviews, someone must have given information leading to arresting the Protestant man, so perhaps it's either one of them.\\n\\nI'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider that since the shooting happened before they arrested anyone, but they had already interviewed both men, maybe one of them provided info about the shooter through their statements during those interviews. So if the shooting was known to them, then either could have given information leading to arresting the Protestant man.\\n\\nBut without more context, it's hard to say for sure. Maybe 'The Muslim man' is the answer because he was interviewed first or something like that. Alternatively, maybe both provided info, but since only one was arrested later, perhaps the info came from him.\\n\\nWait, no, I think the key point is that they had already interviewed both men before arresting the Protestant man. So if during those interviews, either of them mentioned information about the shooter, then that's who helped provide the info.\\n\\nBut without knowing which one actually provided it, maybe we can't determine for sure. However, since the question gives us an option between 'The Muslim man' and 'The Protestant man,' perhaps both are possible, but I have to choose one.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe neither of them directly provided information because they were just suspects until the arrest.
