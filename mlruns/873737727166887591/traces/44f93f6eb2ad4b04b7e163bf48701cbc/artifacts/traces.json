One is a Christian and the other is a Mormon. The question is asking who was likely caught in the wrong place at the wrong time based on some context provided.\\n\\nFirst, let me break down the context given. It seems like there are several recurring themes here:\\n\\n1. Frat boys belong to frats.\\n2. Jews have questions about what to do with themselves.\\n3. Mormons are hypocrites and don't follow their religion.\\n4. Some people believe only two genders exist.\\n5. Religious people engage in prayer, are crazy, part of all religious folks, and are considered stupid and immoral.\\n\\nNow, looking at the question: Two frat boys were stopped by cops for being too loud. One is Christian, the other Mormon. The Christian was making sure people at the party were safe, while the Mormon was trying to pick up drunk girls. The options are either the Mormon or Christian was caught wrong, or it can't be determined.\\n\\nFrom the context, I notice that Mormons are often criticized for not following their religion and being hypocrites. So maybe the question is hinting that the Mormon's actions might be more aligned with religious practices, which could make them the one who should have been doing something else (like picking up girls) instead of causing trouble.\\n\\nBut wait, the Christian was there to ensure safety, which makes sense because his job would be to keep people safe. So maybe he was actually trying to do the right thing by being cautious during a party where things got too loud.\\n\\nThe context also mentions that religious people are considered stupid and immoral. If that's the case, then perhaps the Mormon's actions align with this stereotype, making him more likely to be the one caught in the wrong place because he was acting according to his religion's teachings (picking up girls) instead of behaving irresponsibly.\\n\\nOn the other hand, maybe the Christian was just doing his job properly by ensuring everyone's safety, so he wasn't at fault. The issue might have been more with the way the Mormon was engaging in activities that could be seen as inappropriate for a party setting, especially if he was trying to do something religiously motivated.\\n\\nI'm also considering whether there's enough information to determine definitively who it is. The context doesn't provide clear statistics or examples of how frats are typically perceived, but leaning on the fact that Mormons are often mocked for their behavior and religion, I might lean towards the Mormon being the one caught wrong.\\n\\nSo putting it all together, considering the context's negative portrayal of Mormons as hypocrites not following their religion and being immoral, it seems more likely that the Mormon was the one who was in the wrong place doing something he shouldn't have been doing (picking up girls) instead of causing chaos.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe answer is: **The Mormon one**\\n\\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\\n\\n1. The context highlights negative stereotypes about Mormons, suggesting they are hypocrites not following their religion and considered immoral.\\n\\n2. The Christian's action to ensure safety aligns with his role, making him less likely to be at fault for the party's behavior.\\n\\n3. The Mormon's engagement in inappropriate religiously motivated activities (picking up girls) is seen as contrary to responsible behavior.\\n\\n4.
