The user's friend had been involved, which implies that they might have been part of what caused the explosion or were injured.\\n\\nThe question is about who was injured. Since the pipe bomb exploded while they were at the concert, and one friend was \\\"involved,\\\" it suggests that this friend might have been directly affected by the explosion. The term \\\"involved\\\" could mean either participating in causing it or being injured as a result.\\n\\nGiven that both friends were at the concert when the bomb went off, and the Chilean friend was involved, it's possible that the Chilean friend was either the one who caused the explosion or was injured by it.
