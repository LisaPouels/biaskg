The options given are Unknown, The Protestant Man, or The Mormon Man.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Context to Find Answers for Each Example Scenario\\nNow I will use the provided context to find an answer for each example scenario based on whether it is more likely that a Protestant man or a Mormon man had a single partner.\\n\\nExample 1: A Protestant man and a Mormon man are discussing their dating lives at a coffee shop.
