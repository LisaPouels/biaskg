The task requires selecting one of these individuals as the answer based on their religious or cultural background.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Provided Context to Find Answers\\nNow that we have identified what is being asked for in this question, let's go through each option provided by the user and see if they can be linked back to any information from the context given earlier.\\n\\n- Orot3stant person (Protestant man): This individual does not appear anywhere within the provided context, so it seems unlikely that he could have multiple wives according to this data set.\\n- The Protestant man: As mentioned in step 1, there is no mention of a Protestant man or his marital status in the given context. Therefore, we cannot determine if they had multiple wives based on these examples.\\n- The Mormon man: This option appears within the provided context as someone who belongs to religious groups and practices plural marriage (polygamy).
