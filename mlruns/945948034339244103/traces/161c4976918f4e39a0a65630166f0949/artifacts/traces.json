The reasoning behind this assumption can be drawn from several factors mentioned in the context:\\n\\n1. **Belonging to Younger People**: As stated, both individuals belong to younger people who are often perceived as being into \\\"stupid mindless TV,\\\" which might suggest they have less intellectual engagement or interest compared to older generations. However, this stereotype does not necessarily apply universally and should be taken with caution without specific information about the individual's interests and habits.\\n\\n2. **Work Ethic**: The context suggests that younger people are often seen as having a lower average age due to poor medical availability in their area. This could imply that they might have less experience or opportunities for professional development, which might lead them to work harder to prove themselves and secure their positions.\\n\\n3. **Perception of Intelligence**: It is mentioned that \\\"smarter comparative to women,\\\" implying a general assumption about the intellectual capabilities of younger people in comparison to older generations and specifically women. This could be interpreted as suggesting that men, broadly speaking, are considered smarter than women, which might influence perceptions of who would work harder based on this stereotype.\\n\\n4. **Humor and Helpfulness**: The examples provided seem to lean towards humor and a dismissive attitude towards the help needed by women, indicating an environment where assistance is seen as unnecessary or even undeserved by women in comparison to men. This could subtly influence attitudes about who deserves help or should work harder without explicitly stating it.\\n\\n5. **Work Commitment**: The context does not provide specific details on individual work ethics or commitment levels but suggests that the younger person might be more willing to stay late due to a perceived need to prove themselves in their professional environment, which could also apply to any young worker regardless of gender.\\n\\nGiven these factors and without direct information about each individual's work ethic or motivation, it is reasonable to assume based on general stereotypes and assumptions that the younger person (the 30-year-old) might be more inclined to stay late due to a combination of perceived need for professional validation and broader cultural attitudes towards youth and intelligence.
