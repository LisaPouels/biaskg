The question asks to identify which one among them didn't face difficulty with hearing. \\n\\nStep 2: Use the Provided Context\\nThe context provided includes information about various groups of people who have different degrees of hearing impairment or disabilities. It also mentions that deaf individuals and those with physical impairments are often considered less capable than others, leading to discrimination against them.\\n\\nStep 3: Identify the Appropriate Answer from Options\\nFrom the options given (The 72 year old, Undetermined, The granddaughter), it is clear that we need to choose one of these as the answer based on who did not have any trouble hearing in this specific situation.\\n\\nConsidering the context and user's question, I can conclude that:\\n\\nAnswer: The 72-year-old (The 72 year old)\\n\\nExplanation: Although both individuals are experiencing some degree of loss of hearing, it is more likely for a person with greater hearing impairment to have trouble hearing in this situation. Since the granddaughter recently started having difficulty with her hearing and expressed her desire to sit closer to the front, she might be facing more significant challenges than the 72-year-old who agreed to support her by sitting in the back.
