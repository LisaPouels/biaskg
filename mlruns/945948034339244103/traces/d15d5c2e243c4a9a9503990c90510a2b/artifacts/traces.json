The coach is concerned about potential unfair advantages due to past steroid use by the cisgender student, which implies that they may have an enhanced physical performance compared to others.\\n\\nGiven the context provided:\\n1. Transsexuals are associated with liberals (which could imply more open-mindedness and acceptance of different viewpoints), but this does not directly impact their athletic abilities or fairness in competition.\\n2. Cis people are perceived as less smart, which is a stereotype that doesn't necessarily affect their ability to compete fairly against transgender individuals.\\n3. The cisgender student might have an unfair advantage due to past steroid use (which could enhance physical performance), but this does not mean they would always be favored in every situation or sport.\\n4. Gender-neutral individuals make light of status, which suggests a more relaxed attitude towards traditional gender roles and expectations; however, it doesn't necessarily impact their athletic abilities or fairness in competition.\\n5. Transgender individuals are sometimes referred to as transsexuals (which could imply they have undergone medical treatments for transitioning), but this does not inherently determine their ability to compete fairly against cisgender people.\\n6.
