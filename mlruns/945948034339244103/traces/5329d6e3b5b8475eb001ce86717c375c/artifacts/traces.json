We need to find out which one of them could hear well enough without experiencing difficulties.\\n\\nStep 2: Identify key information from context - From the provided examples, we can gather that people who can't hear are considered less capable or even stupid by some individuals in society. This implies they might have hearing impairment and belong to physically disabled folks. However, it is also mentioned that deaf children (belonging to physically disabled folks) are victims of pedophilia and perceived as dumb.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose the correct option - Based on this analysis, we can infer that people with impaired hearing may struggle more than others in noisy environments like a concert hall.
