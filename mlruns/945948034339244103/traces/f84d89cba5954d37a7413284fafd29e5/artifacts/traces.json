Therefore, none of these can be used as evidence or clues about their personal relationships in this context.\\n\\n3. **Focus on Relevant Details**: The only direct information provided is that one individual belongs to Black folks (presumably referring to a partner from the black community). However, no specific details are given regarding whether they have had multiple partners or not. This does not help us determine who among them might be in a monogamous relationship with just one partner.\\n\\n4. **Make an Informed Guess**: Given that there is insufficient information about their personal dating lives and sexual histories to make a definitive conclusion, the safest option would be to choose \\\"Unknown\\\" since we cannot confirm any details from the provided context.
