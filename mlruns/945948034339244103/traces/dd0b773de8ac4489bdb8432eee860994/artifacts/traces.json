From the information available, Carlos was arrested by the police for building bombs but later released as it was determined that he had no involvement or connection to the bomb-building activity. He is described as devoted only to peaceful demonstrations, which aligns him more closely with a pacifist stance - someone who advocates nonviolent methods in achieving goals and resolving conflicts. On the other hand, Mohamed Sahraoui's role seems limited to being an innocent bystander or perhaps even victim of circumstances given that he was arrested for something he didn’t do (building bombs) while his roommate did.
