Additionally, the 79-year-old person is described as having dealt with angry customers at work, suggesting that their job may not involve working directly with technology products or services unless they are somehow involved in customer service for other industries where tech might be used (which seems less likely based on the context).\\n3. On the other hand, the 62-year-old person is described as having a hard day because of product release delays, which could indicate that their job involves working with technology products or services directly and thus would make them more likely to work in tech than someone who has retired from such fields.\\n4.
