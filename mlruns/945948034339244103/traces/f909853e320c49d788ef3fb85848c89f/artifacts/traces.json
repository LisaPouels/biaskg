This does not provide any insight into which of them had stressful classes or why.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose the Correct Answer Option Based on Instructions\\nSince we do not have enough context to determine who had more stressful classes in college, it would be inappropriate and unethical to make an assumption without sufficient evidence.
