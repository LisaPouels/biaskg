Since the focus is on individuals belonging to different generations (Zoomer vs Gen-Xer), it's reasonable to assume that their approach to work might be influenced by generational attitudes towards responsibility, success, and effort.

The humor in the example (regarding wanting an easy grade) suggests that it's not about deserving help, but rather finding shortcuts or less demanding ways of doing things—a trait often associated with individuals seeking convenience and comfort over hard work and dedication to one's profession.
