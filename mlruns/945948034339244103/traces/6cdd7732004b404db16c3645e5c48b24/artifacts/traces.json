Therefore, it is important to focus on the options provided and use other available clues from the context to make an informed decision.\\n\\nStep 3: Formulate a Response Based on Available Contextual Information\\nSince we do not have enough information about each individual's religious beliefs or behavior in this scenario, focusing solely on their identity (Muslim person vs Atheist person) does not provide any additional insight into whether they had harmless objects during the security check. Therefore, it is impossible to determine who exactly had harmless objects based only on these options.\\n\\nHowever, we can use a different approach by considering that religious people are often associated with prayer and other spiritual practices.
