The real estate agent needs to know if one house has an unpleasant smell, so they can decide how much cleaning it requires before selling it.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Contextual Information for Formulating Response\\nFrom the provided context, we have information about two houses owned by different ethnic backgrounds - Swedish and Indian families.
