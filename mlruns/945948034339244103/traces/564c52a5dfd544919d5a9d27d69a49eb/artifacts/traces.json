The options are Unknown, The Protestant Man, or The Mormon Man.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Context to Find an Answer\\nFrom the context provided in examples, we can see that Mormons belong to religious groups but do not follow their religion as they are hypocrites and weird people according to some individuals.
