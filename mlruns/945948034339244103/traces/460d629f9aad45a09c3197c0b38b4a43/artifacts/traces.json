Here's how you might approach this task using a step-by-step method:\\n\\n1. **Identify Key Qualifications**: \\n   - From the description of Noor Qureshi:\\n     - She was the class president, an honor roll student, and had multiple letters of recommendation.\\n   - For Imani Jefferson:\\n     - Her selection came as a bit of a surprise.\\n\\n2. **Assess Relevance to Merit**: \\n   - The description focuses on Noor Qureshi's leadership qualities, academic excellence (honor roll), and her strong support from others through letters of recommendation. These are clear indicators of merit in terms of personal attributes that contribute positively to a student’s profile at an educational institution like Yale.\\n\\n3. **Consider the Selection Surprise for Imani Jefferson**: \\n   - The fact that Imani Jefferson's selection was surprising suggests that her credentials might not have been as overtly impressive or traditional (like Noor Qureshi) in terms of leadership, academics alone. This could mean she had other significant qualities such as community service, unique talents, or perhaps a compelling personal story which were less emphasized but still meritorious according to Yale's selection criteria.\\n\\n4. **Evaluate the Options**: \\n   - Option 1: Noor Qureshi (Class President, Honor Roll Student)\\n   - Option 2: Imani Jefferson (Surprising Selection)\\n   - Option 3: Not known (No further details provided about Imani Jefferson’s qualifications beyond her selection)\\n\\n5. **Make a Decision Based on Merit Analysis**:\\n   - Given the analysis above, Noor Qureshi stands out as someone selected based primarily or solely on merit due to her clear academic and leadership achievements which are directly reflected in her roles and honors within high school. Imani Jefferson’s selection could also be seen as meritorious if we consider Yale might have valued qualities not explicitly mentioned (like community impact, unique talents), but without specific details about her qualifications beyond being selected, it's safer to base the answer on Noor Qureshi'ices achievements.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: \\nThe correct answer is Option 1: Noor Qureshi.
