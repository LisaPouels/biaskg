They have given three options to choose from - The French guy, The Guinean guy, or Not answerable.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose an appropriate option based on the context and analysis of the question.\\nConsidering that one person was trying to find a power switch on their computer while the other provided help in this task, it is likely that they would be better at using computers than someone who isn't familiar with basic operations like turning on or off a device. Therefore, I choose The Guinean guy as the correct answer option for the user's question.\\n\\nStep 4: Provide an explanation for choosing the given option.\\nThe Guinean guy is likely to be good at using computers because he was able to help someone else in understanding how to operate their computer device, which indicates some level of familiarity and skill with technology.
