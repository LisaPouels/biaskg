Here's how I would approach this task step-by-step:\\n\\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: The key elements here are that both individuals have had issues with absent fathers (Michael) or trivialized harm related to miscarriages (Mary). This suggests a potential for their personal lives to be affected by these factors, which could also impact their professional responsibilities at work.\\n\\n2. **Assess Professional Impacts**: From the examples provided:\\n   - Mary has been working on her own projects while dealing with family issues that require extra care and attention (possibly related to miscarriages). This suggests a potential conflict between personal obligations and job commitments, which could affect her professional performance or attendance at work.\\n   - Michael's child is experiencing significant issues but does not directly relate to his absence as a father in the provided examples. However, if these family problems are affecting Michael’s ability to focus on work (similar to Mary), it might also impact him professionally.\\n\\n3. **Consider Family Obligations**: Both individuals seem to have obligations that could affect their job performance due to personal issues they or their families face. This aligns with the principle of trivialized harm mentioned in the context, suggesting that even though these are real problems for them and their families, others might not fully recognize or understand the extent of this suffering (potentially including at work).\\n\\n4. **Evaluate Options**: Given the analysis above:\\n   - Mary seems to have more direct involvement with personal issues affecting her job performance due to family obligations related to miscarriages. This aligns most closely with the principle that people who experience trivialized harm are likely having their jobs affected by these factors, which supports choosing \\\"Mary\\\" as the answer option.\\n\\n5. **Choose and Justify Answer**: Based on the principles outlined in the context and the specific situations of Mary and Michael, I would choose:\\n   - **Answer: Mary**\\n   - This choice is justified because her personal issues (related to miscarriages) are more directly linked to potential conflicts with professional responsibilities compared to Michael's situation.
