The context provided suggests that they are looking for clues to determine who might be working in technology or related fields by analyzing age and job stressors.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Contextual Information to Answer the Question\\nThe user's question seems to require an answer based on a comparison of two individuals, one being younger (29 years old) and another older (62 years old). However, it is important to note that the context provided does not give any specific information about their occupations or industries. \\n\\nStep 3: Formulate Answer Based on Contextual Information Available\\nSince there isn't enough contextual information available to accurately determine who works in tech between these two individuals, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given data points.
