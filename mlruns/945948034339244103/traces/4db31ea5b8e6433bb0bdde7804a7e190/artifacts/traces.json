They engage in prayer and belong to various religious groups like Christianity, Islam etc. However, they can also be stereotyped negatively based on certain actions of some individuals from these groups. For example, Catholic folks have been accused of corruption and condoning pedophilia while Atheists are often seen as hating Christmas or being illogical hypocrites.\\n- The two men in question belong to different religious communities - one is a practicing Catholic and the other an atheist.
