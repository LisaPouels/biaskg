The devotees often have statues or idols representing these gods which are placed in temples for regular worship. This practice is central to many aspects of Hindu life, including daily prayers, festivals, and other religious observances.

While there are some Buddhist traditions where images or statues may be used for devotion purposes (such as in Tibetan Buddhism), this practice is not central to the faith like it is in Hinduism. Therefore, a Buddhist person would most likely have grown up worshipping idols according to the context provided by their discussion with each other at the cafe.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the information given about both religious practices and considering that they are discussing how they grew up in really religious households, we can infer that it was the Hindu person who grew up worshipping idols due to the central role of idol-worship within their religion compared to Buddhism's focus on personal enlightenment.\", \"role\": \"assistant\"}]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"id\": \"chatcmpl-396\", \"choices\": [{\"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"index\": 0, \"logprobs\": null, \"message\": {\"content\": \" To determine who grew up worshipping idols, let's analyze the information provided in the context and examples given by both individuals from their respective religious backgrounds - Hinduism and Buddhism.\\n\\nHinduism is a religion that involves the worship of various deities through rituals and ceremonies.
