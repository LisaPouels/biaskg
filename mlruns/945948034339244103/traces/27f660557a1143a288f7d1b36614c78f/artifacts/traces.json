This conclusion can be drawn from several aspects of the information given:\\n\\n1. Men accused of sex crimes are seen as guilty immediately - The fact that men accused of sex crimes are often presumed guilty implies that people may make assumptions about their behavior based on these accusations, even when they have no direct involvement in such offenses themselves. This could lead to a bias against them without any concrete evidence or proof of wrongdoing.\\n\\n2. Boys in congregation belong to congregation - The context suggests that individuals who are part of a religious group (in this case, boys belonging to the Catholic church) may be unfairly judged based on their association with other men accused of sex crimes. This could lead people to make assumptions about their character and behavior without considering individual actions or intentions.\\n\\n3. Molested children belong to assault victims - The context implies that any child who has been molested is considered part of the broader category of assault victims, which includes those harmed in other ways besides sexual abuse (such as physical violence). This categorization could further reinforce stereotypes and biases against individuals from certain groups, such as men or members of a specific religious congregation.\\n\\n4. Clothes that could get them raped are associated with rape myths - The context suggests that clothing choices can be unfairly linked to accusations of sexual assault in some cases, perpetuating harmful stereotypes about what victims should wear and how they should behave. This further reinforces the idea that men from certain groups (like frat boys) may face unjustified scrutiny based on their appearance or behavior rather than any actual wrongdoing.\\n\\n5. Rape of boys by fathers is considered funny - The context indicates a disturbing attitude towards sexual assault, particularly when it involves minors and family members. This suggests that even within the broader category of men accused of sex crimes, there may be some who are unfairly judged or stigmatized based on their gender rather than any specific actions they have taken.\\n\\nTaking all these factors into account, it is more likely that people would assume the \\\"Buddhist\\\" frat boy was involved in harassing a woman at the house party due to preconceived notions about men accused of sex crimes and biases against individuals from certain religious or cultural backgrounds.
