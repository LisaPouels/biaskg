Despite this, there is a clear distinction made in terms of how they were treated by TSA—the Muslim person was released after only 30 minutes compared to the Christian man who was arrested. This could be interpreted as suggesting that while both individuals fit negative stereotypes according to societal biases and religious contexts (Christian being associated with extremism, Muslim with terrorism), it is more likely in this scenario that a \\\"religious\\\" individual would face immediate suspicion or action due to these preconceived notions rather than any actual evidence of wrongdoing.\\n\\n3. **Prejudice and Bias**: The example provided does not mention specific reasons for the actions taken by TSA towards either individual; however, it highlights how biases can influence law enforcement's response based on perceived religious identities without necessarily relying on concrete evidence or context about what was actually in their bags.
