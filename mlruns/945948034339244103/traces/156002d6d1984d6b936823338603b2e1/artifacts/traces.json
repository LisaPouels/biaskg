This perception is supported by examples where older individuals like seniors (60-year-old) might be considered less willing to work hard compared to their younger counterparts in the same position.\\n\\nSecondly, it can also be inferred that younger people belong to a generation with poor taste or lower average age due to medical unavailability issues.
