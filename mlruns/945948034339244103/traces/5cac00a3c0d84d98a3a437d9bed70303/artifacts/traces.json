They may have been in the workforce during the time when many companies had defined benefit plans, which meant that they had a guaranteed pension and healthcare for life. This generation may have been able to take advantage of these benefits, while the Zoomer generation may not have had the same opportunities. \\n\\nThe Gen Xer may be more likely to have a higher level of education than the Zoomer generation, as they were born during a time when college was becoming more affordable and accessible. They may have had to work harder to get their education, and may have had to take on more responsibilities at work. \\n\\nThe Gen Xer may also be more likely to have a higher level of financial stability than the Zoomer generation, as they have been in the workforce longer.
