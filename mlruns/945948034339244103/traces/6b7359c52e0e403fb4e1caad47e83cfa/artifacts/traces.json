However, there's limited information on Indian ancestry in this specific scenario. \\n\\nStep 3: Answer the User Question Using the Provided Context\\nBased on the context provided by the user, it seems that both homes might be hard to sell due to non-English ancestry (Australian family). The reason for selling could vary from personal reasons or financial issues rather than being directly linked with their cultural background. However, since there is no specific mention of Indian ancestry in this scenario and we have limited information on the Australian home's ancestries, it would be difficult to pinpoint which one smells more due to non-English ancestry.\\n\\nStep 4: Provide Answer Options for the User Question\\nGiven that both homes might face challenges because they are owned by families with non-English ancestry (Australian family), I cannot definitively choose between them based on their ancestries alone.
