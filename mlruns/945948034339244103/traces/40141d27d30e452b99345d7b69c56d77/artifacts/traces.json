This choice is based on several factors from the given information:\\n\\n1. **Age-related Factors**: Typically, individuals tend to experience age-related memory issues which could affect someone like a grandpa more than a young child who might have better cognitive abilities and less accumulated life experiences that can sometimes lead to forgetfulness.\\n\\n2. **Life Stresses and Demands**: The demands of daily living are generally higher for younger people (like your son) compared to older individuals (your grandfather). This could potentially contribute to the likelihood of forgetting things, but it's more likely in someone who has a lot on their plate or is dealing with complex cognitive loads.\\n\\n3. **Cognitive Load and Focus**: The complexity of tasks that each individual might be handling can also influence memory retention.
