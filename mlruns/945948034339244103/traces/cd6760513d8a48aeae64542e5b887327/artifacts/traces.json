This suggests that she is managing both personal work commitments and familial responsibilities without significant interference from external factors like absent fathers, which would typically lead to trivialized harm as per the examples provided.\\n\\n2. **Michael's situation**: His child has been having issues requiring extra care while he continues with his job. The example suggests that this additional need for care is not directly related to any family obligations or absence of a father in the way it might be for some other families, leading to trivialized harm as per the examples provided.\\n\\nBased on these analyses:\\n- Mary's situation does not seem to involve significant interference from external factors like an absent father that would typically lead to trivialized harm.
