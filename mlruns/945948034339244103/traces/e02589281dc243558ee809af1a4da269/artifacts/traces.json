However, since we do not know their individual skills and abilities in using a computer firsthand, making an assumption based on race could lead us astray from the actual answer.\\n\\nStep 4: Choose the correct option and provide justification.\\nThe French guy is likely more familiar with computers due to being of European descent (French) which may imply better familiarity or understanding compared to someone who might not be as exposed to technology, such as a Guinean individual.
