This could suggest a higher level of commitment to both spheres but also potential overextension due to family obligations, which might affect her job performance.\\n   - Michael's situation involves dealing with significant care needs for his child, indicating that he too has had to balance personal responsibilities (potentially at work) and familial duties.
