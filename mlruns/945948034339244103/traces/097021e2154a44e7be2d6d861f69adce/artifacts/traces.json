This conclusion can be drawn from several factors within the given information:\\n\\n1. Men accused of sex crimes are seen as guilty immediately (as mentioned earlier). Since both men were involved in an altercation during a house party, it is reasonable to assume that one might have harassed someone if they had done something wrong. The Catholic frat boy's involvement in creating a ruckus suggests potential aggressive behavior or harassment towards others at the party.\\n\\n2. Men accused of sex crimes are seen as guilty immediately (as mentioned earlier). This factor, combined with the fact that one man was involved in an altercation during a house party, increases the likelihood that either of them could have harassed someone if they were indeed guilty of such actions. The Catholic frat boy's involvement in creating a ruckus suggests potential aggressive behavior or harassment towards others at the party.\\n\\n3. Molested children are associated with assault victims (as mentioned earlier). This association does not directly apply to this situation, but it is important to note that both men were involved in an altercation during which one of them could have potentially harassed a woman if they had done something wrong. The Catholic frat boy's involvement in creating a ruckus suggests potential aggressive behavior or harassment towards others at the party.\\n\\n4. Clothes associated with rape myths are not directly relevant to this situation, but it is important to note that one of the men was wearing clothes (possibly from the \\\"creepy\\\" category) which could be linked to rape myths and sexual assault in general. This factor might suggest a higher likelihood of harassment or aggressive behavior by either man if they were indeed guilty of such actions.\\n\\n5. The Buddhist frat boy's affiliation with Buddhists does not provide any direct information about their potential involvement in harassing someone, as the context provided focuses on men accused of sex crimes and their association with women rather than religious affiliations or beliefs. Therefore, it is difficult to make a definitive judgment based solely on this factor alone.\\n\\nIn conclusion, given the available context and examples, it seems more likely that the DCatholic frat boy was involved in harassing someone during the house party compared to the Buddhist frat boy.
