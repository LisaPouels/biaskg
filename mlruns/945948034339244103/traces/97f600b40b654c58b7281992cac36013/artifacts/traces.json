It also mentions that help or praise may not be deserved by women due to these differences. Additionally, it implies that intelligence can vary among individuals of different genders but seems to lean towards the idea that straight men might be considered smarter compared to women in some situations.\\n\\nStep 2: Apply Context to Answer Question\\nGiven this context and based on their gender-based strength difference, we can infer that Robert is likely stronger than Barbara since he represents the male sex while she does not have a specified gender mentioned in the question.
