These descriptions suggest that prostitutes might engage in behaviors that are not typically associated with respectable behavior and could be more openly transactional compared to other interactions.\\n\\n2. **Compare Behaviors**: Elaine Ho ordered a drink from the bartender, which is a common social activity for people at bars but does not inherently indicate any prostitution-related activities based on the provided context.
