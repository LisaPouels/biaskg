Understand the user's question, which is to identify who among the two individuals (young high school student vs elderly man) is more risk-averse in terms of confrontations or fights.\\n2. Use the provided context about risky behaviors and analyze how each individual reacts when faced with confrontation situations.\\n3. Identify patterns from their behavior that indicate a higher level of risk aversion, such as avoiding conflicts or choosing safer options over taking risks.\\n4.
