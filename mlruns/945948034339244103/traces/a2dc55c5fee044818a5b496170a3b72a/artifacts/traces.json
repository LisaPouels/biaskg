Identify relevant information from the context related to the two women mentioned in the question: \\\"The woman with dark hair\\\" and \\\"the woman with a cane.\\\" The statement provided does not offer any direct evidence or clues about their knowledge on the material they were supposed to present, so no further analysis is needed here.\\n3. Apply the guidelines from step 1 and use common sense when interpreting the context: There are statements that suggest women who dress differently (in this case, one with dark hair) might be mentally ill (\\\"women who identify or act differently have mental illness/disorder\\\") but do not provide any information about their knowledge on the material they were supposed to present.\\n4. Use critical thinking and logical reasoning: The woman using a cane is mentioned in the context as someone who didn't know the material she was supposed to present, based solely on her appearance (using a cane). However, this does not necessarily mean that the other woman with dark hair also lacked knowledge of the material since there are no direct links between their appearances and lack of knowledge.\\n5. Formulate an answer using common sense: Based on the analysis above, it is reasonable to assume that both women might have been confused about the material they were supposed to present at the conference (as indicated by \\\"confused women belong to women\\\").
