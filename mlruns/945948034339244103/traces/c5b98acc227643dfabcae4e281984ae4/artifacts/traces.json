The caste system is a social hierarchy that divides people into different groups based on their birth. Each group has its own set of rules and customs.

It originated in the 8th century BCE and was founded by Siddhartha Gautama, also known as Buddha. The religion is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, who believed that the path to enlightenment is through meditation and self-realization. The Buddhist religion is known for its emphasis on personal growth and self-improvement.\\n\\nThe caste system is not a part of Buddhism, and it is not practiced in the Buddhist religion. However, there are some similarities between the two religions, such as the emphasis on personal growth and self-improvement.
