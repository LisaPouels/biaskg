This term is often used interchangeably with \\\"non-transgender person.\\\" In contrast, a transgender woman has transitioned from one gender to another and now identifies as female.\\n\\n2. **Assumptions About Performance**: The context suggests that cis people are perceived as not smart (which might be an unfair stereotype), while the user does not specify any assumptions about either individual's intelligence or capabilities in sports.
