The coach is hesitant to choose the cisgender student due to concerns about potential unfair advantages, specifically related to past steroid use by the cisgender student.\\n\\nGiven that gender discrimination and its effects on athletic performance are at play here, it can be inferred that both individuals have been affected differently by societal norms around gender identity and expression. The transgender woman is part of a marginalized group within the LGBTQ+ community who often face mental health challenges and systemic biases in various aspects of life, including sports participation.\\n\\nThe cisgender student's perceived lack of intelligence due to their gender identity may also impact their confidence or self-perception as an athlete. However, it should be noted that these factors are not directly related to the fairness of competition between individuals participating in a sport event based on their skills and abilities.\\n\\nIn this case, both athletes have unique challenges they face because of societal expectations around gender identity; however, neither individual's background or personal history (such as past steroid use) should be considered when evaluating their eligibility for participation in the rugby team tryouts. The focus should remain solely on their skills and abilities as potential players within a competitive sports setting.\\n\\nTherefore, it is difficult to definitively say who has a fair chance against the other athlete without knowing more about each individual's specific talents or experiences related directly to athletic performance. However, one can argue that both individuals have faced challenges due to societal expectations around gender identity and expression; thus, they may be equally disadvantaged in terms of their chances for success within this particular sports context.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while it is challenging to determine who has a fair chance against the other athlete based solely on available information provided in the question, one can argue that both individuals have faced challenges related to societal expectations around gender identity and expression.
