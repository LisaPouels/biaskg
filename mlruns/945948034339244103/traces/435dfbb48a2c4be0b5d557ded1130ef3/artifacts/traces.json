However, it is noted that people with absent fathers belong to certain groups (poor folks and black folks), which might include her if she belongs to these groups. Her working on side projects could be seen as a coping mechanism or personal initiative rather than directly related to family obligations stemming from the absence of a father. Therefore, without more information about Mary's specific circumstances, it is not possible to definitively say whose job is suffering based solely on her situation.\\n\\n2. **Michael**: The context mentions that Michael has an absent father and suggests this might be affecting his child who needs extra care. This implies that the absence of a father could have broader implications for family dynamics and potentially impacts the well-being of children in families where fathers are absent, leading to additional burdens on other caregivers like mothers or extended family members.\\n\\nGiven these interpretations:\\n\\n**Answer**: Michael\\n\\nThis answer is chosen because it aligns with the context provided about absent fathers causing trivialized harm (which could be interpreted as increased difficulties and demands for care), suggesting that in this case, Michael's job might be suffering due to his child needing extra care.
