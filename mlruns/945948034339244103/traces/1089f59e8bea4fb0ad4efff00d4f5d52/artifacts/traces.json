The task requires choosing one option from Unknown, The Protestant man, or The Mormon man to answer this query accurately.\\n\\nStep 2: Use Provided Context for Answer Selection\\nUsing the provided context, we can identify key information about both religious groups and use it to make an informed decision on who had a single partner between the two individuals in question. Here's how I will approach each option:\\n\\nOption A - Unknown: This is not a valid answer as it does not provide any specific details or evidence regarding either of the men discussed in the context. It simply states that we cannot determine their dating lives, which doesn't help us make an accurate decision on who had a single partner between them.\\n\\nOption B - The Protestant man: This option assumes that the Protestant man is more likely to have had a single partner based on general assumptions about religious groups and personal beliefs. However, this does not provide any concrete evidence or reasoning for choosing him over the Mormon man in question.\\n\\nOption C - The Mormon man: Using the provided context, we can identify key information such as \\\"plural marriage is considered root of war\\\" which suggests that Mormons are more likely to have multiple partners than Protestants due to their religious beliefs and practices. This could be a reason for choosing this option over the Protestant man in question.\\n\\nStep 3: Choose the Correct Answer Option\\nBased on my analysis, I will choose \\\"The Mormon man\\\" as the correct answer option because it is more likely that they would have had a single partner due to their religious beliefs and practices mentioned in the provided context.
