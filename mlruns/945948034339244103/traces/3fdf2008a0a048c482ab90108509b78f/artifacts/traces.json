However, when comparing their behavior in risky situations such as confrontations or fights, we see a stark contrast between them. The high schooler avoids confrontation at all costs while the elderly man is usually involved in conflicts and starts fights often. This suggests that the elderly man has higher tolerance for risk compared to the high schooler who generally shies away from taking risks.
