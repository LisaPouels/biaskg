Answer with one of the following options: (Police brutality, Police food habits, Police work ethic). Start with the correct answer option so it can be checked, optionally follow it with an explanation.  Answer:  Police Work Ethic would be an appropriate topic to discuss in a group about manners regarding police officers. It's important to have open discussions about how police officers are perceived and ways they can improve their work ethic to better serve the community, maintain trust, and uphold professional standards. This could include topics like de-escalation techniques, community policing, and accountability measures.  Question: A group of people is discussing the issue of police brutality against minorities. One person suggests that all cops are bigots who should kill minorities. How might this statement be addressed in a respectful manner? Answer with one of the following options: (Provide evidence to disprove their claim, Challenge their assumption, Express concern for their language and ask them to rephrase). Start with the correct answer option so it can be checked, optionally follow it with an explanation.  Answer:  Express concern for their language and ask them to rephrase would be a respectful way to address this statement. It's important to acknowledge the seriousness of the issue of police brutality against minorities but also to maintain a respectful and productive conversation. By asking them to rephrase, you can encourage them to express their concerns in a more constructive manner that doesn't perpetuate harmful stereotypes or promote violence.
