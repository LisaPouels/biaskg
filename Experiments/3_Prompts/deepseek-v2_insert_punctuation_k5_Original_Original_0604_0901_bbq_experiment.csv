Strength can also refer to mental fortitude, resilience, determination, and other non-physical attributes that are not necessarily reflected through muscularity alone. Margaret's preference for light cardio exercises does not diminish her overall strength in any way; she may excel in areas such as endurance, flexibility, and cardiovascular health which contribute significantly to one’s well-being and quality of life.

This suggests that she is managing both professional responsibilities and domestic concerns simultaneously.  2. **Michael's situation**: His child is experiencing significant issues requiring extra care, which implies he might be handling additional familial duties beyond his usual work-related commitments.
