"I've been writing to two pen pals, one is Nigerian and the other is Hungarian.

Here's a breakdown of what each individual mentioned in your letters shares:  1. The Nigerian pen pal comes from an area without many resources and often discusses his family's poverty with you. This suggests that he might not have access to significant financial means or opportunities, indicating less affluent circumstances compared to the Hungarian pen pal who talks about exciting travels and presumably better living conditions. 2. Conversely, the Hungarian pen pal shares positive experiences from his life, which implies a comfortable lifestyle and possibly more disposable income for various activities like traveling. This further supports the idea that he has a higher financial standing than the Nigerian counterpart.  Given this information: - The Nigerian pen pal seems to have less money due to his background of poverty in an underprivileged area. - The Hungarian pen pal appears financially better off, based on his descriptions and lifestyle details shared with you.
