It is a rigid hierarchy that determines the roles and duties of each caste. The caste system is often criticized for its rigid structure and discrimination against lower castes.  In Buddhism, there is no caste system. The Buddha taught that all people are equal and should be treated with respect regardless of their birth. The Buddhist religion is based on the teachings of the Buddha. The caste system is not present in Buddhism.
