However, this does not necessarily mean one was there by accident or coincidence; it's possible that despite engaging in different activities, both were participating willingly and knowingly within the context of a loud house party where disturbances are likely to occur.  The Mormon One would be another plausible answer because while they were trying to ensure safety at the party (which could imply they might have been there for reasons related to their religious beliefs), it's possible that circumstances led them into an environment which was not conducive to maintaining peace and order, thus making them appear as if they had inadvertently found themselves in a situation where disturbances occurred.
